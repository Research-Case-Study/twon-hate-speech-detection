The tweet expresses a observation about queer men and their preference for slightly too small white t-shirts.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

The tweet has been labeled as ""normal"" because the user is primarily expressing an observation or a question about a perceived trend among queer guys wearing slightly too small white T-shirts. Although the language used includes the phrase ""what the fuck,"" which can be considered vulgar, the overall tone of the tweet appears to be inquisitive rather than hostile or derogatory towards the LGBTQ+ community.

The term ""queer"" is used here, which is a reclaimed term by many in the LGBTQ+ community but can also be seen as sensitive depending on the context. However, given that the context does not clearly indicate an intent to demean or discriminate against homosexual individuals, and considering that ""queer"" is often used in contemporary discourse as an umbrella term for non-heterosexual identities, the use of this term alone does not classify the tweet as hate speech or offensive.

The tweet's focus on fashion choice (wearing slightly too small white T-shirts) rather than making a statement about sexual orientation or gender identity itself also suggests that it is more of an observation or a query about cultural or social phenomena within certain communities, rather than an attack or derogation. 

Therefore, despite the use of potentially offensive language in a casual context (""what the fuck""), the overall intent and content of the tweet do not align with hate speech or overtly offensive categorizations but rather a curious or perhaps even self-reflexively critical observation about social trends.",124.07

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 2: There are no clear key features in this text that indicate hostility, harm, or stereotypes towards any particular group, including ""queer guys.""

Step 3: The target of the text is identified as ""Homosexual,"" but the tone and content do not display any derogatory, offensive, or hateful language. Instead, it is a question-and-observation statement about a fashion trend among some homosexual men.

Step 4: The overall context and tone of the tweet are neither positive nor negative, simply expressing curiosity regarding a common fashion preference within a particular group. There is no intent to harm, offend, or stereotype anyone in this text.

However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the tweet is not necessarily hate speech or overtly offensive, but rather an observation that could be perceived as slightly mocking or stereotyping.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

This means that the content of the tweet does not contain language or intent that would classify it as hate speech or offensive.
Step 2: Although no key features are highlighted, a key phrase for consideration here could be ""queer guys"". This phrasing is significant because it refers to a specific group, but without derogatory intent. The rest of the sentence discusses a perceived trend within this group in an almost conversational tone, with no overtly harmful or degrading language.
Step 3: The target identified is 'Homosexual'. The text does not appear to attack or demean this group. Instead, it makes a casual observation about a trend (""slightly too small white t-shirts""). This can be considered a form of stereotype, but in the absence of clear derogatory language or intent, it's not necessarily offensive.
Step 4: Contextually, the tone appears light and conversational with the use of ""what the fuck"", which is often used to express frustration or disbelief in an informal setting. However, this term can be highly subjective and might be considered offensive by some, even though it's directed at a general concept rather than a person or group.
Conclusion: This text is classified as neutral because while it does mention a specific group (""queer guys"") and makes a comment that could potentially lead to stereotype, there is no harmful language used against this group. The context indicates an informal tone with the potential for some to find it offensive due to the use of vulgar terms like ""what the fuck"", but without any clear intent to harm or demean a particular individual or group.

Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:

The statement is a factual report of events without any explicit derogatory, hateful, or harmful language targeting a specific individual or group based on characteristics like race, religion, or ethnicity. It lacks the intention to incite hate or violence, which is key to labeling content as hate speech.

Label -> Offensive
 
“pocahontas jumps in bed with moslem terrorists interesting combo”

Explanation:
This statement is labeled offensive because it uses derogatory language and stereotypes to insult and demean individuals or groups. Referring to someone as ""Pocahontas"" in a pejorative context is disrespectful, and associating them with ""Muslim terrorists"" perpetuates harmful stereotypes and biases, making the comment offensive and inappropriate.

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

3) ""pro tip the niggers do not care if you never owned slaves granddaddy fought the natzis or great great grandad ground the confederacy into dust with the boot heel of the proto bolshevik yankee gubment force of weight and arms behind it they hate you because you are white and you exist altright""

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet has been labeled normal because it appears to be a positive reference to paying tribute to the rapper Nipsey Hussle, who is known for a specific shade of blue affiliated with the Crip gang culture of LA. The user mentions wearing a ""Nipsey blue suit"" and states that only certain individuals (""the niggers"") at their workplace can appreciate or ""feel the energy"" of this fashion choice.

However, it's essential to acknowledge that the use of the term ""niggers"" is highly problematic and offensive. This word has a long history of being used as a racial slur to demean and dehumanize Black people. Its usage, even in contexts where the speaker claims to be referencing a specific cultural or social group, perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to a hostile environment.

Given this complexity, some might argue that the tweet should not be labeled as ""normal"" due to its use of derogatory language. The inclusion of emojis (🏃‍♂️ and 🙌) at the end of the tweet may suggest an attempt to convey enthusiasm or positivity, but it does not negate the offensive nature of the terminology used.

Ultimately, the labeling of this tweet as ""normal"" might stem from a contextual interpretation that prioritizes the intended meaning (paying tribute to Nipsey Hussle and sharing a cultural reference) over the literal and historically charged language used. Nonetheless, it's crucial to recognize the potential for harm and offense in such language, even when used in what the speaker perceives as a positive or neutral context.",125.92

The tweet has been labeled normal because it appears to be a positive statement about connecting with others over shared cultural experiences.

The tweet's classification as 'normal' can be debated given its content. The use of the term ""niggers"" is undeniably offensive and racially charged, historically used to demean and dehumanize Black individuals. Despite this, it might have been categorized as normal due to potential contextual misunderstandings or oversights in labeling criteria. 

However, standard definitions and considerations of hate speech would likely classify this statement as offensive or even hate speech rather than normal. The term ""nigger"" is highly derogatory and its usage here targets African individuals with a historically rooted racial slur that perpetuates racism and discrimination. The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by Black colleagues, but this positive connotation cannot justify or mitigate the use of such an offensive term.

The presence of emojis could suggest a celebratory or positive context intended by the user (e.g., dancing person and purple heart), which might have influenced the labeling decision. However, these symbols do not negate the harmful impact of using racial slurs in public discourse, especially on platforms like Twitter where messages can reach diverse audiences.

In summary, while labeled as 'normal,' this tweet contains language that many would consider offensive or hate speech due to its use of a deeply offensive racial epithet. This classification discrepancy highlights challenges in consistently applying labels across different contexts and perspectives within social media monitoring systems.",192.57

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 2: There are no explicit key features in this text that suggest hostility or harm towards any group or individual.

Step 3: While the term ""niggers"" can be considered a derogatory and offensive term when used to refer to people, in this context, it seems the user is referring to the color Nipsey Blue, which is associated with rapper Nipsey Hussle. The term is likely being used descriptively rather than targeting any specific group. The emojis used also suggest a sense of pride or belonging.

Step 4: The overall context and tone appear to be lighthearted and celebratory, as the user shares their personal experience at work while wearing a Nipsey Blue suit. They do not express any hostile intentions or harm towards others.

Conclusion: Despite the use of a historically offensive term in this text, the context and tone suggest that the user's intent was not to target or harm anyone but rather to express their connection with Nipsey Hussle and his music. Therefore, although the term is derogatory when used to refer to people, in this context, it seems more likely that the text should be classified as neutral due to its lack of explicit hostility or harmful language towards a specific group or individual.",19.91

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet

However, this classification might seem ambiguous due to the presence of potentially sensitive language. The tweet reads, ""wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the workplace feel the energy,"" incorporating a term historically and culturally loaded with derogatory connotations towards African Americans.

Step 1: Understanding 'normal' as the label suggests that the content does not contain elements typically associated with hate speech or offensive language.
   
Step 2: The absence of key features might imply no explicit terms were identified for classification. However, the term ""niggers"" is historically and culturally known to be racially charged and derogatory towards African Americans.

Step 3: The target here is indicated as 'African', which aligns with how the use of ""nigger"" can directly impact or refer to people of African descent negatively. 

Step 4: In evaluating context and intent, it's crucial to consider not only the text but also cultural sensitivities and historical connotations attached to specific words. The use of such a term could be perceived as offensive in many contexts.

Conclusion: While the classification labels this as 'normal', the presence of racially charged language raises concerns about its neutrality. In contemporary discourse, particularly on social media platforms where context can often be ambiguous, the use of terms like ""nigger"" is typically considered highly problematic and potentially harmful or offensive regardless of intended meaning. This highlights potential limitations in automated classification systems that might not fully capture nuanced language dynamics related to race and cultural sensitivity.

Therefore, despite being labeled as 'normal', it would be critical for such a system to re-evaluate classifications when potentially sensitive terms are detected, even if they are not listed as key features. Contextual understanding, including historical connotations of specific phrases or words, is essential in accurately assessing the tone and intent behind posts that might otherwise appear neutral but can carry significant negative impact based on their language usage.",255.91

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone.

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist.""

The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Initially, it may seem counterintuitive given the context of refugees and illegal migrants, but upon closer analysis, the key points emerge.

The target is listed as ""None"", which implies that the text does not directly attack or demean any specific group. Considering the context and tone, the user appears to be advocating for a distinction in treatment based on the circumstances of migration, emphasizing the protection of refugees who are victims of persecution. The mention of adding Ahmadi Muslims to the consideration suggests an inclusive intent rather than exclusionary or hateful.

Since there are no key features that signal hate speech or offensive language, and given that the focus is on legal distinctions rather than derogatory characterizations of any group, this tweet falls into the 'normal' category as it does not exhibit discriminatory or pejorative content against an individual or a group based on their identity factors.",257.41

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 2: There are no key features listed, suggesting there are no words or phrases in this text that could be considered harmful or incite hatred. However, the topic of discussion revolves around refugees and illegal migrants, which can be sensitive depending on the context.
Step 3: The target is 'None', meaning the statement does not specifically aim to harm any particular individual or group, but it discusses a divisive issue in politics and immigration - the distinction between refugees and illegal migrants. 
Step 4: The overall context of the tweet involves a request to someone (possibly another user) to add Ahmadi people to a list or discussion, presumably about citizenship rights under certain conditions. While discussing sensitive topics such as migration status and asylum seekers, the tone is not accusatory, discriminatory, nor inflammatory.
Conclusion: This text is classified as 'normal' because it discusses an issue related to refugees and illegal migrants without using offensive language or making derogatory statements. The absence of key features that could indicate hate speech or offense contributes to this classification, along with the fact that no specific individual or group is targeted for harm. Although the subject matter can be controversial, the tone and language used do not cross into territory considered harmful or offensive by the dataset's guidelines.

In summary, it can be safely assumed that the message was intended as a request for clarification or addition to an existing conversation without any malicious intent towards refugees, illegal migrants, or Ahmadis specifically.

Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet is labeled normal as it appears to be a casual observation or statement made by the user.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.

- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

However, upon closer inspection and contextual understanding, this classification might seem questionable as it could potentially be interpreted in a harmful manner.

Step 2: Despite there being no key features listed here, certain words like ""camel jockey"" are often used as pejorative terms to mock Arab people. This phrase is rooted in stereotypes that paint the Middle East and its inhabitants with a broad brush of primitive nomadic lifestyle, which can be considered offensive by some.

Step 3: The target mentioned in this case could potentially be Arabs or no one specific. Considering ""camel jockey"" within an Arab context, it is clear that the message indirectly targets those from the Middle East. 

Step 4: In terms of user intent and overall context, without more information about the situation around this tweet, it's hard to definitively say whether it was meant as offensive or neutral. However, considering ""camel jockey"" is often used in a derogatory manner towards people from the Middle East, it is possible that the author intended to stereotype and mock Arab people.

Step 5: The label 'normal' in this case might not be completely accurate based on our analysis. While it could be interpreted as neutral in some contexts, given the use of ""camel jockey,"" which can be an offensive term for people from the Middle East, there is a possibility that this text was intended to mock and stereotype Arab individuals. Therefore, while labeled 'normal', one might consider it as leaning towards being offensive due to its potential to perpetuate negative stereotypes about Arabs.

In conclusion, although initially classified as normal, given the context and possible derogatory language used (""camel jockey""), a reevaluation of this text's classification would be warranted considering its potential offensiveness toward Arab people. This highlights how labels can sometimes need deeper analysis and interpretation in light of cultural sensitivities and specific terminology that may carry harmful connotations.",256.29

Your Job is to analyze the tweet and write **Explaination** on it by taking inspiration from the examples bellow. 
Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:

The statement is a factual report of events without any explicit derogatory, hateful, or harmful language targeting a specific individual or group based on characteristics like race, religion, or ethnicity. It lacks the intention to incite hate or violence, which is key to labeling content as hate speech.

Label -> Offensive
 
“pocahontas jumps in bed with moslem terrorists interesting combo”

Explanation:
This statement is labeled offensive because it uses derogatory language and stereotypes to insult and demean individuals or groups. Referring to someone as ""Pocahontas"" in a pejorative context is disrespectful, and associating them with ""Muslim terrorists"" perpetuates harmful stereotypes and biases, making the comment offensive and inappropriate.

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

3) ""pro tip the niggers do not care if you never owned slaves granddaddy fought the natzis or great great grandad ground the confederacy into dust with the boot heel of the proto bolshevik yankee gubment force of weight and arms behind it they hate you because you are white and you exist altright""

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet has been labeled normal because, at first glance, it appears to describe a scene or setting without explicitly expressing hate or derogatory intent towards Arabs. The term ""camel jockey"" can be considered derogatory when used in certain contexts, particularly if it's meant to demean or stereotype individuals of Arab descent. However, the phrase ""Middle East watering station"" adds context that might suggest a more neutral or descriptive intent, possibly referring to a real or hypothetical setting without necessarily aiming to offend.

Given the lack of clear derogatory language or direct attacks on Arabs in this tweet, and considering the possibility that the terms used could be interpreted as part of a descriptive narrative rather than an insult, the label ""normal"" might reflect an assessment that the content does not overtly promote hate speech or discrimination. However, it's crucial to recognize that labeling can sometimes depend heavily on context, cultural sensitivity, and the nuances of language use, which may vary greatly among different observers. The term ""camel jockey"" is historically associated with negative stereotypes about Arabs or Muslims, suggesting a need for caution in interpreting such language as entirely neutral.",93.26

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Now, write an explanation for the given input using this reasoning framework.

Step 1 of the analysis confirms this, as the label suggests a lack of hostility or controversial elements. Step 2 involves examining the key features, but in this case, there are no specific words or phrases identified as crucial to the decision, which further supports the classification as normal. Step 3 considers the target, and since it is listed as ""None"", the text does not appear to be directed towards any particular group or individual, reinforcing its neutral nature. Step 4 evaluates the context and tone, which in this instance, seems to be a positive or at least benign comment about appearances, given the phrase ""they all look good in white"". The overall conclusion is that this text is classified as normal because it lacks any elements of hate speech or offense, does not target any group, and maintains a neutral, possibly complimentary tone, making it a non-controversial statement.",81.69

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.

2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers.

“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

The tweet is labeled offensive due to the use of derogatory language aimed at a specific group, in this case, homosexuals. The term ""faggot"" is historically and culturally used as a slur against gay men, intended to degrade and demean them.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

Step 1: The label of the text is offensive, suggesting it contains derogatory language or harmful stereotypes that do not reach the level of hate speech.
Step 2: The key feature in this context is the use of the term ""faggot,"" which is a highly pejorative term historically used to demean and stigmatize individuals perceived as homosexual. This term contributes significantly to the classification by conveying disrespect and hostility towards the target group.
Step 3: The target, in this case, is the homosexual community. Using such derogatory language can create an environment of hostility or discomfort for members of that community, contributing to a climate of discrimination and prejudice.
Step 4: Considering the context and tone, it appears the user's intent is to demean or provoke someone they perceive as homosexual. The explicit nature of the statement adds to its offensive quality by using vulgar language in a threatening manner.
Conclusion: This text is classified as offensive due to the presence of a derogatory term targeting the homosexual community. The use of such pejorative language, combined with the explicitly threatening and vulgar tone, creates an environment that can demean or threaten members of this group without necessarily inciting direct violence or harm. It reflects social stigma and prejudice against homosexuals by using historically charged and negative language to provoke or insult the target.

In summary, the classification as offensive is justified because it includes derogatory terminology (""faggot"") aimed at a specific community (homosexuals), creating an atmosphere of disrespect and hostility. The explicit and threatening nature of the statement further emphasizes its offensive character by using vulgar language in a demeaning context.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.

Your Job is to analyze the tweet and write **Explaination** on it by taking inspiration from the examples bellow. 
Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

It lacks the intention to incite hate or violence, which is key to labeling content as hate speech.

Label -> Offensive
 
“pocahontas jumps in bed with moslem terrorists interesting combo”

Explanation:

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:

   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers.

However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""

   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""

Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet is labeled as ""offensive"" because it contains derogatory language towards women. The use of terms such as ""bitches"", ""dumb"", and ""hoe"" are highly offensive and demeaning, perpetuating negative stereotypes and misogyny. These words have historically been used to degrade and belittle women, contributing to a culture of sexism and disrespect.

Furthermore, the language used in the tweet is dehumanizing, reducing women to objects or inferior beings. This kind of rhetoric can contribute to a hostile and discriminatory environment, where women are marginalized and disrespected.

Overall, the combination of derogatory language, aggressive tone, and sexist undertones makes this tweet unequivocally ""offensive"" towards women.",84.01

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

The context suggests a personal grievance or frustration directed at specific individuals, possibly in response to perceived interference or criticism. These key features are explicitly offensive, targeting women with pejorative labels that historically have been used to demean and dehumanize them. While hate speech often involves broader stereotypes or systemic biases against a group, the use of such language still constitutes offensive content due to its intent to belittle and disrespect based on gender. The inclusion of ""cough cough"" might indicate sarcasm or coded language, but it does not mitigate the offensiveness of the terms used. Overall, this tweet is classified as offensive because it uses derogatory language that historically targets women, reflecting a lack of respect and perpetuating negative stereotypes about their character and behavior.

{""post_id"": ""1208954317465643008_twitter"", ""tweet_text"": ""<user> you don't deserve to live. You are a disgrace to humanity."", ""key_features"": [""disgrace"", ""don't deserve to live""], ""target"": ""Individual"", ""label"": ""hate speech""}

In this tweet, the user expresses extreme hostility and disdain towards an individual with phrases like ""you don't deserve to live"" and labeling them as a ""disgrace to humanity."" These key features go beyond mere offensive language; they suggest a desire for harm or removal of the target from society, which can be considered hate speech due to its dehumanizing nature. The context implies a personal conflict, but the intensity of the words used transcends ordinary disputes and enters into territory where it could incite violence against the individual based on perceived attributes that make them unworthy in the eyes of the speaker. While there is no explicit reference to identity factors such as race or religion, the statement's severity—calling for someone not to exist because they are a ""disgrace to humanity""—can be interpreted as an attack on their very being and place within society, potentially targeting perceived identity traits that led the user to form this extreme judgment. This classification as hate speech is justified by the tweet's dehumanizing language and the suggestion of undeservedness in life based on unarticulated but implied characteristics.

{""post_id"": ""1208954378577362945_twitter"", ""tweet_text"": ""I can't believe how many people still don't get that <user> is a master troll. He's just doing it for the reaction!"", ""key_features"": [""master troll""], ""target"": ""Individual"", ""label"": ""neutral""}

In this tweet, the user comments on an individual's behavior with the term ""master troll,"" indicating their perception of the target as someone who provokes reactions intentionally. The context and key feature suggest a light-hearted or analytical tone rather than one of hostility or prejudice. Calling someone a ""troll"" might be pejorative in certain contexts, but here it appears to describe the individual's tactics without denigrating them based on identity factors such as race, gender, or religion. Instead, the term is used within the context of online behavior and does not convey hate speech or offensive language. The user seems to express surprise at others' lack of awareness regarding the individual's motivations rather than any derogatory intent towards the target. Therefore, this tweet falls under the neutral category as it discusses someone's actions without engaging in hateful or demeaning language.",415.88

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Now, write an explanation for the given input using this reasoning framework.

The key features are the words ""bitches,"" ""dumb,"" and ""hoe."" These terms are often used in a demeaning context to refer to women, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and contributing to an atmosphere of disrespect towards women. Here, these words serve to belittle and insult, targeting specifically women as indicated by the term ""bitches"" which is typically used to derogatorily refer to women. The user's intent appears to be expressing frustration or contempt towards a woman or women in general; this is supported by phrases like ""cough cough,"" which might imply mocking or subtle emphasis on the preceding statement. However, the tone falls short of explicit threats or violence that would classify it as hate speech. Thus, considering the language and context, the text is appropriately labeled as offensive because it uses disrespectful and derogatory terms towards women without inciting direct physical harm.",142.43
