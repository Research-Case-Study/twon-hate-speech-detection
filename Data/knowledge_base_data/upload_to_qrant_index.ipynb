The tweet says: \"we cannot continue calling ourselves feminists if the rights of all womxn aren\\'t addressed yes to a sexual offences public list but will a trans lesbian bisexual and queer womxn be able to enter their information on the reporting sheet gender forum\". \\n\\nFirst, I notice that the user is talking about feminism and ensuring that all women\\'s rights are addressed. They mention a sexual offenses public list, which sounds like a registry or something similar for people who commit sexual offenses. Then they ask if transgender, lesbian, bisexual, and queer women can enter their information on a reporting sheet related to gender forums.\\n\\nSo, the main points here are about inclusivity in feminism and ensuring that marginalized groups within the community have access and representation. The key features mentioned are \"womxn\", which is an inclusive term for women, often used to encompass all genders. They\\'re addressing different sexual orientations: trans, lesbian, bisexual, queer. \\n\\nLooking at the classification process steps:\\n1. The label is normal, so it doesn\\'t contain hate speech or offensive language.\\n2. Key features: \"womxn\" and various identities mentioned are inclusive terms, not derogatory or harmful.\\n3. Target group seems to be the feminist community and specific subgroups within it, but without any negative targeting.\\n4. The context is about advocacy for inclusivity and addressing systemic issues, so the tone is concerned but constructive.\\n\\nSince there\\'s no use of hate speech or offensive language, just a discussion about ensuring all groups are included in feminist efforts, it makes sense that this tweet is classified as normal. It\\'s promoting awareness and equality without attacking anyone.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n\\nThe tweet is classified as \"normal\" because it discusses inclusivity within feminism and raises concerns about the representation of marginalized groups. Key features include the use of inclusive language (\"womxn\") and mentions of various identities (trans, lesbian, bisexual, queer), all of which are presented in a constructive manner to advocate for equality. The target is the feminist community, aiming to highlight the need for comprehensive support without any negative targeting. The tone is concerned but focused on positive advocacy, lacking offensive or harmful language.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe tweet promotes inclusivity and awareness within feminism, using respectful and inclusive terms without any derogatory language, thus fitting the classification of \"normal.\"',\n",
