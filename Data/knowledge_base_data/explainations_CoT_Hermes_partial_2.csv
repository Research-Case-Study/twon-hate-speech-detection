1. Label implication: The label of normal implies a lack of hate speech or offending content in the text.

2. Key features support neutrality as they are absent, not targeting any group with derogatory language.

3. Targeting is not apparent or aimed at causing harm to a specific group based on this text alone.

4. Context and tone do not convey malice but rather debate/discussion without explicit hate speech.

5. Conclusion: This classification is justified by the absence of discriminatory language, slurs, or targeted harassment in the tweet's content and tone. While discussing a controversial topic, it does so neutrally without perpetuating hate speech.

In summary, this text lacks the key features and intent that would classify it as hate speech or offensive. Its neutral tone and context affirm the normal classification by not targeting harm towards any group, allowing it to be seen as a general statement rather than a malicious attack on an audience.

Classification: Neutral
The tweet text is classified as normal for several reasons:
1. Label Implication: The text itself does not contain hate speech or directly offensive content. It appears to be a statement about someone's judgment of another person based on their political beliefs.
2. Key Features: There are no key features that support the classification as hate speech or offensive language. The tweet does not contain any derogatory terms, slurs, or discriminatory words.
3. Target Group: Although the text references characteristics like race (white), religion (Christian), sexual orientation (queer), and political beliefs (supports Trump), it does not target these groups with malice or to offend.
4. Context & Tone: The tone seems more observational than malicious. It states someone's judgment of another person without promoting hate or harm towards any group.
5. Conclusion: Based on the absence of hate speech, offensive language, and targeted malice, this text can be classified as normal. Its content is political but does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or incite hatred.

This analysis concludes that the text is a statement about someone's judgment rather than an attempt to offend or promote hate. It does not contain the crucial features of hate speech or offensive language to justify those classifications. As a result, it can be seen as normal based on its content and tone alone, without the characteristics that define more problematic speech.",20.09

This tweet is classified as normal for several reasons:

1. The user expresses conflicting emotions towards someone, stating both hate and love. This inner conflict doesn't target any specific group.

2. The key features are missing, but the context revolves around a radio song and a senior co-worker, not promoting hate or targeting an offense. 

3. There is no target mentioned for this tweet to reference or directly impact.

4. The tone appears reflective as the user discusses their emotions with a senior colleague regarding a popular trend (""getting rick rolled""). This casual context negates any malicious intent.

In conclusion, without key features supporting hate or targeted offenses and with the benign context of discussing a song and colleague, this tweet is normal in nature and not meant to cause harm. Its classification as normal reflects its innocuous content.",11.09

- Reference to an Indian accent being used in a negative context, implying the ridicule of South Asian people.
- The implication that Arab or Muslim individuals should be harassed and ridiculed.

This text clearly targets the Arab and Muslim communities through language that dehumanizes and disparages them. The intent is clear given the history of such terms being used to bully Arabs/Muslims.

The derogatory term perpetuates ethnic stereotypes and discrimination, making it categorizable as hate speech.

The key feature of using this explicit slur aimed directly at an ethnic minority group is the primary basis for its hate speech classification. This language trivializes harm caused to the target audience while promoting discriminatory stereotypes.

Additionally, the context surrounding the usage of ""nigger"" in a purported interaction with another individual (""jasmine tweeted this man job and still got to tweet"") implies that it was used as a means of derogatory abuse or taunting rather than neutral discussion. The intent appears to offend based on race and ancestry.

The fact that the user received a temporary ban (""got disabled for <number> hours"") further validates the severity of the hate speech used, likely due to violation of platform guidelines against discriminatory language. 

In conclusion, this text is definitively categorized as hate speech given its explicit use of a racial slur with clear intent to offend and abuse an ethnic group.

The usage of this term perpetuates ethnic stereotypes and discrimination against people based on their race.

Key features that support this classification include:
- Using the n-word: This word has been used historically to degrade and dehumanize individuals of African descent.
- Statements implying violence/threats: ""waiting for your shit"" and ""I got to even this"" suggest an intent to harm or take action against someone, further solidifying the offensive nature.

The text specifically targets people of African origin with a derogatory term. This language is meant to offend and demean individuals based on their race.

Given the context of using hate speech and violent threats towards a specific group, I classify this as a highly offensive text due to its discriminatory intent and harm. The tone implies hostility and perpetuates ethnic stereotypes, making it an egregious example of offensive content.",12.03

- Making a discriminatory comparison between <user> and the targeted group.
The impact of this text on Caucasian people, especially those of lower socioeconomic status (the target), is to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and face ridicule based on their race and class. The context of using such language in a public forum adds to the offense.

Key features include the terms ""redneck"" and ""hillbillies,"" which are disparaging labels often used to demean individuals from rural areas, particularly in the Southern United States. 

These words have a clear negative connotation when directed at others as an insult. The user's response calling another person a ""redneck hillbilly"" perpetuates these stereotypes while also referencing racial slurs (e.g. ""Caucasian""), which are deeply offensive.

The tone of the post, especially the phrase ""you are a redneck hillbilly,"" has an aggressive and derisive nature. The fact that the user had to delete their tweet to regain access further supports its offensiveness.

- The use of the slur ""Arabia"" instead of Arabic, implying a lack of knowledge or respect for proper terminology. 
- The blanket statement about most Arab countries being uncivilized except UAE, generalizing Arabs negatively based on religion/culture.

Summary: The tweet's assertion that feelings aren't mutual and the derogatory statement about women categorizes it as offensive due to the gendered slur and sexual content.
Key Features:
- Use of the term 'ain't shit' in reference to women, which is an explicit gendered slur targeting women with vulgar language. 
- Implied sexual connotation of ""feelings"" being unreciprocated (women not reciprocating feelings) in a vulgar manner.

Context/Tone: The vulgarity and derogatory nature of the statement, especially using the 'ain't shit' term to describe women, suggests an intent to offend and demean women.
Conclusion: The offensive classification is justified due to the explicit gendered slur targeting women and the sexual connotation. While ""feelings"" could be interpreted as platonic, the overall derogatory tone and vulgar language supports the offensive nature of this tweet when directed at women.

Classification: Hate Speech
Summary: The derogatory term 'beaner' used to describe an ethnic group, combined with advocating harm towards a disabled person, categorizes it as hate speech.
Key Features:
- Use of the slur 'beaner', which is a racial epithet used to disparage and offend individuals of Mexican descent.  
- Advocating harm against an individual with Down syndrome, perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

Target Group: Mexican people, those with Down Syndrome
Context/Tone: The tweet's intent appears to be mocking and disparaging both ethnic groups in a derogatory manner while advocating harm towards a disabled person.

Key features:
   - The term 'bitch' is a vulgar slur used to demean women. Its usage here perpetuates misogynistic stereotypes and trivializes the harm caused by such language, especially when directed at a group without provocation.

Target:
   - The tweet targets women as a collective gendered identity, referring to them with a derogatory and objectifying term.

Tone & Context:
   - The overall tone is dismissive, trivializing the actions of women while using an offensive term.
   - There is no context that could justify this language or make it acceptable.

Conclusion:
This tweet is classified as offensive due to its use of a gendered slur directed at women with a disparaging and dismissive tone. It perpetuates misogynistic attitudes through vulgar derogatory language and trivializes the harm caused by such speech towards an entire gender identity.

- The targeted audience appears to be both African men and women.
- The vulgar sexual content promotes harmful stereotypes and trivializes sexual violence against women, specifically the Black community.
- Based on the explicit use of derogatory slurs aimed at a specific race and gender group, this text is classified as highly offensive. Its tone perpetuates negative ethnic and gendered stereotypes.

- Targeted at the president's race rather than policy, aiming insults at his ethnicity.

Classification: Offensive

This tweet uses derogatory language to mock and insult a person named Sougou. The term ""incel"" has been used as a slur, implying involuntary celibacy or unattractiveness. This alone would classify it as offensive.

However, the real impact comes from the degrading reference to body odor targeting Sougou. Being told by multiple women that he cannot smell his own feet implies he is unwashed and repulsive. This crude body-related insult targets and shames Sougou, mocking him for being unhygienic.

The intent of this tweet appears to be humiliating Sougou as much as possible through vile ridicule. Its language targets a person with the purpose of embarrassing them publicly. This leads me to classify it as offensive due to its explicit, body-related slurs targeting an individual.",12.83

4. Calls for deportation without regard for assimilation.

The context of this tweet is sensitive given current political discourse around migration, religion, and gender. The user's intent appears malicious in perpetuating harmful stereotypes and advocating harm towards a vulnerable minority group.

Tone & Context: 
A negative sentiment towards this individual is expressed, but the reason for it isn't specified. In isolation, the text can be seen as offensive due to its intensity.

The mention of race in terms like ""he black"" and ""okay to be white"" does not contain derogatory intent, as they seem more conversational than offensive.

The tone and context suggest the user is expressing their opinion without explicit malice. Key features are absent due to the lack of specific keywords signaling hate speech or offensively targeted language. The text's target appears to be another user (""Alec""), but the impact is more a personal disagreement than a broadly harmful generalization.

In summary, this tweet does not contain the essential qualities of hate speech or offensive content as it lacks explicit slurs/derogatory terms and the tone appears conversational rather than maliciously hateful. The references to race are used in an apparently descriptive manner rather than targeting any group with offense.

The text does not appear to target any specific group or demographic in an offensive manner. Rather it seems to be a personal anecdote shared for comedic effect with no malicious intent.

The text relays an incident but does not use abusive language to generalize a racial group.

This text is classified as hate speech due to the use of a racial slur (""nig"") and derogatory language targeting African people. The author's suggestion that a group can be defined by scientists, combined with the ethnic slurs directed at Jewish people (""kike""), shows clear discriminatory intent. 

The key features of ""scientists decide"" and ""anti nig"" support this classification as hate speech. The usage of such derogatory terms in targeting two specific racial groups perpetuates harm.

In conclusion, the text's blatant use of a notorious racial slur to promote African voter suppression categorizes it as hate speech without question, given the target and key features involved in this clear instance of race baiting.",12.02

- The text explicitly targets Muslims, using offensive language to demean their faith and character. Its aim seems to be inciting hatred rather than sparking constructive discussion.

Key features:
- The term ""towel head"" is a derogatory slur used to target individuals of South Asian descent, particularly Muslims.
- ""Go back to your communist country"" perpetuates negative stereotypes about an individual's nationality or region.

Impact on the target group:
The text directly targets a person based on their race and religious beliefs. The language used dehumanizes the person as an outsider and associates them with communism, implying disloyalty or treason.

Tone and context: 
The aggressive and dismissive tone of ""go back to your communist country"" indicates a clear intent to offend and exclude the target individual based on their perceived race and beliefs. 

Conclusion:
Based on the text's use of explicit ethnic and religious slurs against an individual, its perpetuation of discriminatory stereotypes towards Muslims or people from certain countries, and its aggressive tone implying disloyalty, it is appropriately classified as hate speech intended to offend and dehumanize the target group. The key features are clear indicators of a malicious intent to harm based on race or religion.",14.32

Summary: This text is classified as hate speech due to its use of derogatory language targeting a racial group and sexual orientation. The tweet uses the slur ""niggas"" which carries racist connotations when referring to people of African descent, combined with the term ""queer"" to denigrate men who identify as homosexual or bisexual.

Key Features: 
- The n-word is a well-known racial epithet used historically to demean and degrade individuals of African ancestry. Its use here perpetuates that harm.
- Queer is also utilized in an offensive manner, implying that being queer (LGBTQ+) is undesirable or shameful.

Target Group:
The tweet directly targets people of African descent with the slur ""niggas"" as well as gay/bisexual men by using ""queer"". This makes it a clear attack on both race and sexual orientation.

Tone & Intent: The tone is derogatory and demeaning. Using hate speech to ridicule targeted groups implies malicious intent, especially when paired with terms like the n-word that have been used historically in oppression.

Conclusion: This tweet's use of well-known slurs to demean and degrade a racial group and sexuality aligns it with the definition of hate speech. The derogatory language combined with clear targeting and apparent malicious intent justify this classification.",15.89

The context appears to simply reference two products - White Claw and White Devil. These seem to be names of beverages rather than ethnic epithets. The tone does not convey malice or offensiveness.

- The usage of a racial slur like ""white trash"" to demean and denigrate Caucasians as a whole. 
- The implication that individuals are born with certain qualities or ""hot steaming piles"" based on their race.
- The targeting of a specific ethnic group for ridicule, implying inherent inferiority.

The overall tone is one of contempt and disgust towards the target race. Rather than blaming individual actions, this tweet generalizes entire groups in an offensive manner without regard for harm caused.

Its use perpetuates stereotypical and derogatory language aimed at this group.
- The casual usage of a racist term in the tweet, even when joking or trivializing its meaning, still contributes to the normalization of such offensive language and makes it acceptable to dismiss a group based on their race.
- While the intent may not be malicious hate speech, the classification is justified due to the inherent offensiveness of the slur used. The reference to ""Chinaman"" and lack of remorse or self-awareness of harm caused justifies its label as offensive language.

The reference to ""those nat geo videos"" framing seems to suggest a scientific curiosity about sexuality comparable to documentaries exploring nature, without expressing judgment or harm towards anyone.

This text is classified as hate speech due to its use of extremely derogatory language targeting African people and women. Key points include:
- The slur ""bitch"" aimed at the target woman 
- The usage of ""nigger lover"" in a negative context
- The reference to ""<number> half breed nigglets"", which is a dehumanizing term implying the woman's children are less than human due to their mixed race
- The inflammatory phrase ""<number> baby daddy"" to further demean and insult.
The intent behind this hateful language appears to be to offend, harass and oppress the targeted groups with the most vicious slurs possible. This text perpetuates ethnic and gender based discrimination in a highly malicious manner.

In conclusion, the hate speech label is justified due to the extreme derogatory terms used to specifically target African people and women in an oppressive manner. The key features support this classification by showcasing a clear intent to offend with highly abusive language.",17.09

1. The usage of derogatory terms targeting women such as ""bitches"" and ""pussy"". These words are vulgar slurs used to demean and objectify women.

2. The tone of the tweet has a misogynistic nature, implying the speaker has been wronged by being deceived about the woman's intentions or promiscuity (""must thought i was pussy""). This language contributes to harmful stereotypes against women.

3. The intent behind the tweet appears to be disparaging towards women as a group based on these terms and the context of discussing their promiscuity, which would offend most people.

4. As ""bitches"" is directed at women in general with clear negative connotations, this tweet's language and tone are offensive to them.

In conclusion, the vulgar slurs used against women, misogynistic stereotypes, derogatory implications towards female promiscuity, and clear offense make this an offensive post by the provided guidelines.

This targeted language, particularly in a context that degrades women as objects of lust rather than people with agency, has an impact on women's self-perception and safety. 

The tone appears trivializing and demeaning towards women. Intent behind the tweet is more focused on objectifying women than engaging in respectful dialogue.

In conclusion, this text's use of a disparaging, dehumanizing term for women while celebrating harmful behaviors demonstrates its offensive nature based on features and impact. It falls into the category of ""offensive"".",10.86

- The term used is an extremely derogatory racial slur, but it was not used to directly target or reference any specific individual. No African person was mentioned.
- There are no key features that justify this as hate speech besides the inclusion of a well-known racist epithet. 
- Though the N-word was used, there was no target referenced, and it wasn't even directed at a group. The term was simply stated without context or provocation.
- The intent appears to be making an offhanded remark rather than actively expressing hatred for any racial group.
- In conclusion, while the language is undoubtedly offensive, this is not necessarily hate speech without context or targeting of a specific individual/group.

Classification: Offensive
- This tweet uses an extreme racial slur in a provocative manner. 
- The term has no place being used casually like that in public discourse.
- African people as a group are targeted by the use of such language. It perpetuates ethnic slurs and stereotypes.
- There is nothing but hate speech here; its purpose is to offend with the N-word alone.
- In conclusion, without any context, this can be seen as an outright offense directed at Africans in general due to how the slur was used.

Classification: Hate Speech
- The use of the N-word as a racial slur makes this categorize under hate speech. 
- There are no other features besides the term itself that would classify it otherwise.
- African people as a racial group were targeted by using that slur, even without context or targeting any specific individual.
- The intent is clearly to offend with the inclusion of such language; there's nothing else but hate here.
- In conclusion, this needs to be classified as hate speech due to its direct reference to and targeting of Africans via that extreme slur, regardless of other factors.",21.11

4. The tone appears to be descriptive rather than discriminatory or hate-filled.
5. In conclusion, the absence of derogatory terms, sensitive contexts, or targeting of groups prevents this from being classified as hate speech or even simply offensive.

In general terms, the message's meaning and impact depend heavily on context, which is not provided here. Without further information about what the person meant by ""these white birds,"" we cannot conclusively classify this as anything but a normal, potentially harmless statement.

The key features are not specified in a way that supports hate speech or offensive language. If ""white"" referred to a racial group and there was additional content promoting harm or discrimination towards them, it would be classified differently.

The key features point to no particular derogatory slurs, inflammatory rhetoric, or incitement of violence against a specific race, religion, gender etc. The tone seems more playful and imaginative rather than malicious. 

As the target is unspecified, it doesn't seem to be directed at any particular group or demographic with the intent to offend. Rather, this tweet appears to be describing an unlikely hypothetical situation involving the person's wife without harm.

In summary, while the text does contain a sensitive concept like kidnapping, its context and lack of targeted language classify it as normal given the seemingly fictional nature and absence of malicious intent or hate speech towards any group. The classification is justified due to this overall benign tone rather than an intent to offend or perpetuate harm.

- While there is no specific target group directly addressed, the general usage of such language towards women as a group makes it inherently offensive.

The use of explicit profanity combined with disparaging terms targeting a broad demographic establishes an overall tone of malice towards females. This tweet's intent appears to be belittling and demeaning women based on the author's chosen vocabulary.

While this may be factually accurate based on data, the way it is presented here as a comparison perpetuates harmful stereotypes and generalizations about entire racial and sexual orientation groups.

3. There are no qualifiers or context provided for these statements. Instead of offering a factual statement that could start an open discussion, the abrupt phrasing used here can be interpreted as offensive to both targeted race and sexual orientation identities being referenced.

4. The use of comparison in such a charged topic like police violence against minority groups only serves to further stereotype. It's not meant for an academic or informative purpose but to offend through the sheer mention of this sensitive subject applied to these groups.

This text is classified as hate speech due to the use of a homophobic slur (faggot) targeted at Fadel. The key feature of using derogatory language against LGBTQ+ individuals in a negative manner supports this classification.

The target group here are homosexuals, with the term ""faggot"" directly attacking their identity and perpetuating harmful stereotypes. The vitriol directed towards Fadel as ""that dickweasel"" further emphasizes the offensive nature.

While the user attempts to deflect responsibility for causing offense, the hateful language cannot be ignored. The explicit slur used to demean a person's sexual orientation or gender identity is characteristic of hate speech.

The key features in this post are the references to Four Loko and vodka which suggests that the tweeter is warning against combining these substances, potentially out of concern for the other person's health or safety.

The target audience seems to be someone who may have been considering or attempting to mix alcohol beverages in a risky manner. While the response could come across as slightly confrontational with the statement ""you were asking for it"", it appears the intention is more preventative than malicious. The tone and context do not contain any derogatory language, slurs, or hate speech.

The key features of the tweet are the profanity and the name-drop of the TV show Queer Eye and kale. However, these do not constitute hate speech as they are used in a humorous, non-targeted manner.

As the target appears to be neither queer individuals nor anyone else specifically, this cannot be classified as hate speech or offensive language based on the content alone. The context seems to be casual rather than malicious.

- It references a Nazi in context with this target group, implying they are comparable or deserving of persecution like Nazis.

This text is classified as hate speech due to its derogatory and inflammatory language targeting both the African and Muslim communities. The key features that support this classification include:
- Using the term ""moslem"" in a derrogatory manner, especially with the word ""terrorists"", which perpetuates negative stereotypes of Muslims.
- Associating ""rape gangs"" with an ethnic or religious group is extremely harmful. This language sexualizes violence and implies the targeted group has a higher propensity for rape.
- Referring to African people as ""negro gangsters"" in this context trivializes their struggles as a racial minority that faces disproportionate amounts of crime and violence, compared to other groups.

This text's clear derogatory tone towards both Africans and Muslims, alongside its perpetuation of harmful stereotypes around terrorism and sexual violence, categorize it as hate speech. The use of these terms together implies the author is intentionally trying to offend, rather than simply making an ignorant comment.

- Misogynistic and homophobic references in describing a woman's supposed ""turning more liberal"" and comparisons to Bruce Jenner. 
- The term ""pseudo"" used dismissively with ""naturally"" in describing gender identity perpetuates harmful stereotypes.

- The comparison made between being a ""faggot"" and a ""disrespectful child"" seems to be more of an expression of personal identity over harm. 
- The tone is assertive but not malicious in intent.

In conclusion, while the language could be considered offensive by some, its usage here appears to be primarily self-referential as opposed to targeting a group for abuse.

To elaborate - if the text targeted an individual or collective entity with slurs, that would be hate speech. If it used derogatory terms against a group without targeting them specifically like in this case, that's offensive language but not necessarily hate speech. Here the slur is self-referential which further reduces harm and abuse intent.",15.32

Key features include the use of slurs like ""ghetto"" and ""tweak"" combined with explicit profanity. These words are used in a disparaging manner towards a specific ethnic minority.
The mention of ""college bitch"" also uses gendered insults, further adding to the offensive nature as it targets women.
While no direct hate is expressed, the overall derogatory tone, choice of language and targeting of multiple groups makes this post offensive. The user appears to be expressing frustration but in an inappropriate manner that disparages others.

In conclusion, based on the explicit use of slurs and gendered insults targeting ethnic minority and female groups, I classify this as offensive due to its abusive and vulgar tone. The key features are problematic because they perpetuate negative stereotypes with the intent to offend targeted groups.",11.68

This text does not contain hate speech or offensive language targeting any group. While it mentions homosexuality, it does so without derogatory intent. The reference to needing to ""rein in"" one's sexuality may suggest internal conflict but does not perpetuate harm.

The mention of an album providing ""salvation"" implies the speaker finds solace and acceptance through music rather than having to conform to societal expectations regarding their sexual orientation. This supports a narrative of personal struggle with social pressure rather than hate or offense.

The concluding phrase, ""boo bitch,"" is directed at an unspecified person without aggression, likely a friend or someone who would understand it as playful. The overall tone and context lack malice or harmful intent, categorizing this text as normal.

In summary, while the tweet shares the user's personal struggle with sexuality and societal expectations, its language does not target any group with hate speech or offense. The neutral and playful tone support a normal classification for this text despite touching on sensitive subject matter.",13.1

The tone is critical rather than hateful - it questions the common assertion that ""all these inventions"" were made by white people while actually acknowledging their role. This challenges ethnic stereotypes without using derogatory terms or imagery to target any race.

The reference to inventions being ""stolen from slaves who never got credit"" targets a specific racial group in passing, but the overall point is a non-hateful commentary on representation rather than an attack. The context does not perpetuate hate or discrimination.

Key features that support this classification include the reference to rape in prison and the comparison of this harm to killing. The mention of rape targets a specific form of violence and abuse while the implication of lengthy incarceration emphasizes the severity of the threat. 

The target appears to be an individual, but the text does not specify any identifying characteristics. Instead, it focuses on the severity of abuse that person may endure.

Context-wise, this statement is written in the third-person but lacks any additional context that might provide a justification or exception for such violent content. The tone of the post is threatening and harmful.

Summary:
This text is classified as hate speech due to its use of highly derogatory and offensive language targeted at African-Americans (niggas) and homosexuals (faggots). 

Key Features:
- The usage of the n-word and f-slurpep in this context categorizes it as hate speech, as they are well-known slurs with a history of offense. These words have been used to degrade and disparage these groups.

Target Group: 
African-Americans and Homosexuals are targeted through the use of their respective slurs in an extremely derogatory manner. The text explicitly attacks them for sexual contact with women (putting hands on females).

Intent:
The tone is malicious and demeaning, aiming to offend both groups by portraying them as sex-crazed perverts. This reveals a hateful intent.

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, this text falls under hate speech due to its targeted use of the most offensive slurs against Africans and Homosexuals, with a clear malicious intent. The combination of these key features and the abusive tone categorize it as one of the most egregious forms of hate speech.",14.25

The user's response of ""<user> kool fuck you too"" followed by a thumbs down emoji categorizes this as a normal text. The usage of the vulgarity ""fuck"" and wishing the recipient the same is offensive language targeting an individual.

Key features include the profanity, aggressive tone, and direct insults aimed at the target user. The post's context suggests a heated argument or disagreement with another user.

The text's impact on the target is clear - wishing harm while using derogatory language to express contempt and disdain for the recipient. 

However, this doesn't quite meet the criteria for hate speech as it isn't promoting genocide, or inciting violence against a group based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc. It is still an offensive personal attack but more akin to a heated insult.

The overall tone of using ""fuck you"" and the emoji is clearly negative and disparaging, implying the user has ill will towards the recipient. This does not justify categorizing it as hate speech though due to its lack of targeting specific groups.

In conclusion, based on the offensive language used in the post aimed at an individual with a clear intent of disrespect, this text should be classified as offensive rather than normal or hate speech. The classification may have been incorrect in the original data set.",16.07

Key features such as the reference to false accusations and the context of demonized boys suggest that this text may have been intended to be offensive. However, without more detail or any overtly derogatory terms, it does not qualify for an offensive label.

The mention of race (""white"") in a negative light combined with the concept of demonization implies harm towards an ethnic group. This could argue for an offensive classification if the text's intent was to offend. 

However, the brevity and lack of explicit language keeps this classified as normal. The tone is unclear due to the question mark at the end.

In conclusion, while this post may have been intended to offend or perpetuate hate speech against a racial group, its restraint in language keeps it from qualifying for those labels. It is therefore neutral based on the text alone.",11.8

In summary, while the language may be vulgar at times, this post is normal because it does not make use of hate speech, slurs, or targeting of a specific group. Its content, while controversial in some regard, stays within acceptable bounds for an open discussion on a public issue like media violence without perpetuating harm towards any person or community.",11.53

- Lack of explicit hate speech, ethnic slurs or offensive content
- Political commentary rather than incendiary rhetoric

- While some words may seem odd or cryptic like ""lie <user>"", upon further analysis they do not appear harmful. The overall tone is more advisory than threatening.

In conclusion, based on the absence of discriminatory language targeting specific groups, the protective rather than malicious nature of the message, and the lack of identifiable harm caused by the content, this tweet should be classified as normal and lacking in hate speech or offensive material.",13.96

- Key features include the slur ""bitch"" directed at an entire group of females.
- The tweet directly targets and insults women, portraying them as having an attitude problem that needs to be fixed with ""humbility"". This is a harmful generalization against a gender group.
- The vulgar language used has the intent of shaming and putting down a woman or women based on their appearance. This is an offensive tone.

Conclusion: Due to the tweet's use of a derogatory slur targeting women in Boston, while implying they look ""fuckn ridiculous"" as an insult, this text fits the classification of offensive speech towards a gender group, with clear intent and harm behind it.",10.37

- Key features supporting this classification:
   - No discriminatory terms or slurs 
   - Focuses on a general observation rather than targeting an individual/group
- Impact on target: The statement does not single out or offend any group, but rather makes a general comment.
- Context and tone: The text expresses annoyance at the perceived superficiality of some women. However, it avoids targeting any specific race, religion, sexual orientation etc.
- Conclusion: The lack of derogatory language and targeted slurs classifies this as normal. While its sentiment is not positive towards these women, it does not qualify as hate speech or offensive due to the broad scope of its criticism.

So in summary, while this text may be seen as slightly offensive in nature for criticizing some women's superficiality, it cannot be classified as hate speech or even strongly offensive based on its language and content alone. Its normal label is justified by the absence of targeting any specific group with abusive language.",13.49

- While the text references gender, it does so neutrally without any explicit offense or harm towards women as a target group.

This tweet is classified as offensive due to the derogatory and sexually explicit language used, primarily targeting women. 

Key features like ""prolly"" imply a casual nature while ""hoe"" is a vulgar slur for a woman who engages in promiscuous behavior. Its use here perpetuates negative female stereotypes.

The targets of this language are clearly women, as implied by the emojis and derogatory term used. The tone is dismissive and sexually explicit.

The classification as ""normal"" is appropriate due to this text's lack of targeted hate speech or offensive language. While it does contain a mild obscenity (""son of bitch""), the context appears more like an emotional outburst than an intentionally inflammatory remark, especially given the commonality of such expressions in sports commentary.

There are no key features that would justify categorizing this as hate speech (e.g. discrimination against a group) or offensive language used to harm/harass someone. The text primarily expresses the user's strong reaction to an event in the game rather than perpetuating harm.

The tone is more of frustration and exasperation rather than malicious intent on a target. It seems a normal, albeit impassioned response from a sports fan, which explains its ""normal"" label despite the presence of an epithet.",10.86

- This statement targets socialist or leftist ideologies, implying their political beliefs lead to poverty and the deterioration of countries.  
- The use of ""shithole"" is derogatory and offensive in its tone towards these political beliefs.
- The target of this text appears to be any country or society that has embraced socialism as a political ideology.

The classification as normal seems inconsistent with the content's negative impact and offensive language used against a political belief. A more accurate classification would be offensive due to how it disparages leftist ideologies with vulgar, pejorative language. The intent behind this tweet is clearly politically motivated and derogatory towards socialist beliefs.

This analysis is based on the explicit targeting of a political ideology with offensive slurs and negative implications for countries that embrace socialism as a whole. The normal label does not account for the harmful impact of such language usage in the context of political beliefs.",12.74

The tone is primarily one of exasperation and frustration with online discourse rather than malice towards any group. As such, while the language may be coarse, it does not rise to the level of hate speech or offensive content aimed at a specific audience.

In conclusion, this text's lack of targeted derogatory language and its more general use of profanity to express exasperation over online discourse rather than hatred towards a group justifies its neutral classification.

3. While an opinion is expressed about preferring India over other nations, the language remains general and avoids targeted slurs against Muslims or Indians as groups.
4. The tone appears more dismissive of certain travel destinations rather than maliciously offensive.

The key_features, including the discriminatory epithet ""redneck"", support this offensive classification. This term is an insulting way to refer to Caucasian Americans.

This tweet has a negative tone in targeting a specific race group and trivializing their connection with someone's sponsors and advertisers. The intent seems to be disparaging Caucasians.

Summary of Classification:
This tweet is classified as normal because it does not contain any explicit hate speech or offensive language. While the user references experiencing abuse and homophobia from religious groups, including their own family, the text itself refrains from using derogatory terms to describe those who harmed them.

Key Features:
- The user describes themselves as ""queer by nature""
- They mention spiritual abuse and homophobia they endured 
- This occurred at the hands of religious leaders (parish) and family members

Impact on Target Group:  
The user recounts harm inflicted upon them for their sexuality. However, they do not lash out or use slurs against these groups in retaliation.

Tone & Context:
Despite discussing abuse, the tone is matter-of-fact rather than vengeful/vitriolic. The user expresses learning to separate themselves from their abusers' ""disease"".

Conclusion: 
This text does not fit into hate speech as it does not contain overtly discriminatory language. The user discusses past abuse but in a way that refrains from targeting hate at religious groups, even abusive ones. Their own queer nature is stated plainly without using slurs to describe those who judged them for it.

3. The target group referenced is India as a whole country rather than a specific racial/religious minority.

4. The tone appears more concerned about religious equality and balance rather than spreading hate or harm towards any religion in particular.

The key feature is the use of the derogatory term ""niglet,"" which is a variation of a well-known racist epithet with a long history of dehumanizing and demeaning Black people.

The reference to going to the zoo, coupled with feeding the niglet, draws an offensive parallel between black individuals and animals. This is a clear example of hate speech as it employs a slur while making invidious comparisons that have been used historically to degrade African Americans.

There are no redeeming or neutral aspects of this tweet. Its sole purpose appears to be spreading bigotry and harm towards the target group, using an ethnic slur for shock value or provocation. The offensive tone and discriminatory content justify its classification as hate speech without hesitation.

- The usage of the n-word, an extremely derogatory term historically used by white supremacists to dehumanize and degrade black people.

- An emoticon indicating greed or excitement at the prospect of this.
The text directly targets the dignity and humanity of black people while perpetuating racist stereotypes through its language and sentiments. It violates the safety of the targeted group by invoking historically painful slurs in an obviously hateful context.

Overall, this tweet exemplifies hate speech due to its blatant use of an egregious slur with clear intent to offend a racial minority. The key features support a classification that categorizes it as a direct attack on African-Americans' dignity and humanity under the guise of ""reparations.""

This neutral classification is appropriate because:
- There are no discriminatory slurs, derogatory terms or hate speech targeting any specific group.
- The tone has a sarcastic, almost playful undertone with the ""missing the irony completely"" comment and winking face emoji.
- The context is not meant to be offensive but rather to highlight what seems to be an illogical inconsistency in how certain groups view others.

In conclusion, this text does not meet criteria for hate speech or even more nuanced offense. It simply makes a point about double standards without any egregious language, making the neutral label appropriate given the lack of harm or intent to offend targeted groups.

- Making an offensive distinction between shaving habits as if it determines one's racial status
The impact of such dehumanizing language and targeted stereotypes on African people cannot be overstated. It perpetuates the idea that they are inferior to other races.

While it does make comparisons between two groups (those who ""love America"" and stand tall versus those who are described as defending treason, corruption, etc.), the targeted insults are not directed at a specific ethnic, religious, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disabled group.

The key features that support this classification include:
- The use of rhetorical devices like hyperbole (""maga"", ""list goes on"") to emphasize the perceived wrongdoing and hypocrisy.
- No discriminatory slurs or epithets directly targeting a protected class.
- The framing as a moral dichotomy between good vs. evil, rather than inciting hatred towards an identifiable group.

The target is more of an ideological stance (anti-American values) rather than an intrinsic characteristic. This shifts the tone from vitriolic to philosophical, with the intent being to condemn concepts rather than persecute people.

In conclusion, while this text does contain pointed political criticism and comparisons, its language stops short of hate speech or offense.

The tweet_text: ""new law called the hillsborough law must be used first for the cover up by pms mps councillors social services police over the rape of <number> million white children raped by paki muslims"" contains derogatory terms and promotes harmful stereotypes. Key features include:

- The term ""paki"" is a racial slur directed towards Pakistanis.
- Reference to Muslims as perpetrators of raping ""white children"".
- The scale of alleged crimes mentioned, i.e. millions.

These elements contribute to an offensive tone targeting Pakistani individuals and perpetuating racist stereotypes around their religion. The context implies that these groups are inherently violent criminals.

In conclusion, this text's blatant use of a racial slur in an established manner, with casual intent, solidly categorizes it as hate speech. The classification is not based on its impact to the target group but rather on the presence of language meant to offend or disparage ethnic groups.

Key features include the usage of nigger, a well-known racial epithet used to demean individuals of African descent, as well as moslem, misspelling of Muslim while referencing an entire religion. 

The intent behind using such offensive terms is to dehumanize and belittle these groups. The reference to a ""bisexual moslem nIGGER"" creates a harmful stereotype that perpetuates ethnic/religious discrimination.

Furthermore, the mention that this person was ""hawking"" but ""never delivered"" on promises further demeans their character with homophobic undertones. The overall derisive tone and discriminatory language targets multiple groups based on race, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

1. The directive to commit suicide if instructed to by someone else normalizes the act of self-hann and encourages others to do so without fully considering the consequences or alternative solutions.
2. It targets a specific demographic (young people with suicidal ideation) in an extremely insensitive manner, potentially worsening mental health crises rather than providing support.
3. The casual ""just do it"" phrasing downplays the severity of suicide as a response to bullying or harassment.

1. The label of hate speech is appropriate given the explicit, targeted insults at the homosexual community (faggot) and Jewish people (kike). These are clearly discriminatory slurs aimed at specific groups.

2. Key features such as ""fuck you faggot"" directly attack a person's sexual orientation with derogatory language. The repetition of ""fuck you"" amplifies the aggression directed at both targets.

3. Using the words ""faggot"", ""kike"", and ""piece of shit"" in such a vitriolic manner, especially when combined, demonstrates a clear intent to offend and dehumanize these groups. 

4. The vulgar nature and repetition of these insults indicates a malicious purpose. When addressing someone as a ""fuckin kike piece of shit"", it's not meant as constructive criticism but rather a personal attack.

5. Overall, the tweet contains multiple instances of hate speech and slurs directed at specific groups in an aggressive manner, with clear intent to offend. This supports its classification as hate speech.",14.51

The key features ""nigger"" and ""bitches"" are slurs that dehumanize and demean their targets. ""Nigger"" is a racial slur historically used to degrade black people. ""Bitches"" is a misogynistic term for women.
Being aimed at African females, the hate speech has severe impact on those groups' self-worth and safety in society.

- By connecting the two groups in this accusatory manner, the text targets both Islam and men, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and hate.

The text's tone is also hostile and inciteful, implying that a violent march or action against black people may take place based on an upcoming court trial. The mention of ""next year"" suggests a sense of inevitability to the supposed event.

Overall, the explicit content referencing harm towards African Americans coupled with the threatening nature makes this text fit the definition of hate speech. Its intent appears to be more than just offensive language but actually promoting violence and discrimination against an ethnic group.

- The speaker expresses relief over not having to hear comparisons between a given incident (presumably the Holocaust) and another event.
- No controversial content is used in making this statement. 
- There is no clear target group being referenced or harmed by the comparison.

In context, the user seems to be expressing their relief that a certain situation is no longer being compared to the Holocaust or other events, likely due to the hyperbole or trivialization of real harm caused by doing so.

The use of the slur ""beaner"" directly targets and stereotypes individuals of Mexican descent.

Key Features: 
The term ""beaner"" is a well-known ethnic slur used to disparage people of Hispanic origin, especially Mexicans. Its usage in this context perpetuates harmful stereotypes.

Target:
This post clearly targets Hispanics with derogatory language, using a slur that has been historically associated with anti-Mexican sentiment. The implication is that the poster believes they are inferior and unworthy of interaction.

Intent:
The poster's intent is to express superiority over an ethnic group through a cowardly insult. Their usage of slurs to avoid in-person interactions while disparaging Hispanics indicates malicious intent.

Context/Tone:
The post uses a slur in a demeaning manner, implying the targeted group is incapable or undesirable for direct interaction. This tone perpetuates ethnic stereotypes and discrimination.

- The tweet compares media coverage of a brutal attack on an Afghan Muslim vs. a German girl.
- No hate speech or targeting language used towards the specified groups.

The label classifies this as normal due to its neutral nature, despite referencing sensitive topics and demographics. Key points include:

1. Comparing the media's coverage of attacks on two different ethnic/religious groups. 
2. Referring to the victims using their respective demographic categories.

However, the tweet does not contain hate speech or targeted language aimed at either group. It instead focuses on the media's response rather than perpetuating stereotypes or slurs.

The key features of referring to them by this slur combined with insults support the classification, implying harm and offense towards the target audience.

This tweet clearly targets Jewish people, using one of many anti-Semitic slurs to dehumanize them in an argumentative situation.

The derogatory nature and clear intent behind the slur categorizes this as hate speech aimed at Jewish individuals, perpetuating bigotry against this religious/ethnic group.

The text is classified as normal due to its neutral and lighthearted content. It does not contain any controversial language or targeted slurs at a specific group.

Key Features:
- The discussion about what shoes to wear on one's birthday 
- The use of an emoji signifying it's a positive post 

Target Group: None, the text is discussing an individual's plans for their own birthday

The key features in this analysis are the casual tone and descriptive nature of the text. It does not contain any slurs, stereotypes, or discriminatory terms. Additionally, it is simply describing a cultural phenomenon rather than aiming to offend or disparage a particular race, religion, or other protected class.

There doesn't appear to be an intended target in this tweet either, as it is making a general observation about communication style rather than singling out a group for criticism or malice. The context and tone further reinforce the neutral classification by presenting this as a lighthearted, relatable comment rather than hate speech or offensively derogatory remark.

In conclusion, based on its innocuous language, descriptive intent, lack of targeting, and casual tone, I classify this text as normal with no discernible harm or offense.

- The use of ""hoe"" to describe someone is disparaging and has racist overtones due to its origins as a derogatory term for African Americans.

3. General tone and context: The message appears to be an abstract poetic statement rather than a direct attack on the target group (refugees). 

4. Unclear meaning: The tweet's intended impact is ambiguous due to its figurative nature and lack of clear harm or perpetuation of stereotypes against the target.

5. No promotion of hate: The tone and language used do not actively promote or perpetuate harmful beliefs towards any specific ethnic, religious, sexual orientation, or other group.

Summary: 
This text contains a string of profanity directed at another person. The repetition of hate speech towards an individual is a clear violation of social norms and basic human respect.

Key Features:
- The repeated use of the f-word, a strong profanity
- Repeatedly stating ""I hate you"", targeting and directly addressing the recipient 
- Using all caps for emphasis, increasing the severity

Target Group:
The text specifically targets another user or individual with malicious intent. 

Context & Tone:  
The tone is one of extreme anger, hostility and malice towards the target. The context of a personal message compounds this.

Conclusion:
Given the direct hate speech, profanity, targeting an individual, and threatening context, this would be classified as ""hate speech"". The label of ""normal"" does not align with these factors present in the text.",12.5

- The name ""Clarence"" is used without derogatory intent or stereotyping; the user seems to genuinely wonder who this person is.

- There are no discriminatory slurs, ethnic references, or offensive terms targeting any protected groups. 

Considering the context of casual inquiry rather than malicious hate speech, and the lack of targeted offensiveness aimed at a specific group, the text's classification as normal is appropriate. The overall tone is inquiring and humorous rather than harmful or hateful.

There is no evidence that this post aims to offend any group, and its overall tone seems lighthearted and focused on describing a gaming experience rather than hate speech or offensive language.

- Reference to a person's sexual orientation (""delta male"") with a disparaging tone.
- Gendered insults like ""bitch"" and ""twat"".
The overall intent is clearly malicious, expressing bigotry through the use of such slurs and demeaning language. The context suggests this was said to degrade or mock someone in the targeted groups.

The key features of this text include the usage of derogatory terms like ""nigger"" and ""faggot"". These words are targeted slurs aimed at African and homosexual groups respectively.

However, despite these controversial terms being used to reference certain demographics in a disparaging manner, their utilization here serves more as an observation or critique rather than a direct attack. The tweeter appears to be commenting on the hypocrisy of idubbz regularly using such language without facing repercussions.

While the text does contain offensive content and targets specific groups, it doesn't perpetuate hate speech itself. Instead, it seems to be critiquing others' behavior more so than actively attempting to harm or offend.

The context of this tweet is more that of an observation or exasperated remark rather than a malicious attack on the targeted demographics. The tweeter's tone suggests frustration at the lack of backlash for idubbz rather than actual hatred.

The text directly targets people of African descent by using a slur historically associated with discriminatory treatment and oppression. This categorizes it as hate speech targeting this racial group.

Tone & Intent:
- The tone is trivializing and flippant regarding the sensitive topic of race.
- The author's intent appears to be provocative or humorous, but the language used perpetuates harm regardless of intention.
- ""Nigger"" carries a heavy history of oppression and abuse. Using it as an endearment implies the author's disregard for its impact.

Conclusion: 
The text's use of the n-word slur aimed at black individuals classifies it as hate speech due to the term's derogatory nature and history of discrimination. Regardless of intent, such language perpetuates harm and categorizes it as hate speech targeting African people.",15.08

- Ableist slur (""retarded"") to mock those with mental disabilities

- Key features like the slur's usage in an exclusionary manner (""instead of"") demonstrate how it is weaponized against the target group. This perpetuates harmful stereotypes and dehumanizes Hispanics as unworthy of coexistence with the speaker.
- The text directly targets individuals of Mexican heritage, making them the subject of ridicule and disdain. The assertion that they would rather have a flying car than be amongst ""beaners"" shows their view is exclusionary rather than an unfortunate remark in passing.

1. The label suggests a neutral classification. This implies that while the tweet may contain controversial elements like profanity and a reference to an individual in power, it does not necessarily qualify as hate speech or offensive language.

2. Key features are absent from this analysis. Had the text contained targeted slurs, violence, or graphic content, that would have been highlighted. The absence of these factors supports its neutral classification.

3. The tweet appears to be referencing a political figure (Modi) and his visit to Chennai, mentioning sexual activity towards individuals in that region with an ethnic slur (""niggers""). However, it does not directly target the group being referenced for harm or perpetuate hate speech. Rather, it seems to be mocking a recent event in a non-veiled manner.

4. While the context and tone are confrontational, the text lacks clear intent to offend or promote hatred towards the mentioned racial minority. The tone is more playful than malicious. This suggests an attempt at humor rather than hate speech.

5. In conclusion, based on the analysis above, I classify this text as normal given its lack of key features supporting hate speech, absence of clear malice towards the target group, and apparent intent to poke fun at a political figure's actions rather than promote racial hatred.

- The term ""menace"" has an innocuous meaning in this context as it describes a character's playstyle rather than any real-life group.

The text does not target or offend any specific person/group with hate speech. Its tone is more light-hearted and frustrated regarding the game rather than anything maliciously bigoted.

Explanation:
The text discusses a concerning situation where an older generation dismisses the younger generation's efforts to protect women's rights. However, the language used is neutral and does not contain hate speech or offensive content targeting any specific group.

Key Features:
- The text describes a disagreement between generations on protecting women's rights.
- It mentions rape in a marital relationship but without derogatory intent.

Target Group: Women
The text references women as an affected party in the context of marital rape. However, it does not generalize or stereotype women negatively.

Tone and Intent:
The tone is informative rather than offensive or hate-filled. The user's intention seems to be raising awareness about an issue rather than discriminating against any group.

Conclusion:
Based on the lack of discriminatory language, derogatory terms, and stereotyping directed at a specific group, this text falls under the normal category despite mentioning rape in an abusive context. Its intent is to highlight a serious issue rather than hatefully targeting anyone.",13.12

- Implying the need for ""diversity"" in order to cover up such crimes.

The key feature here is the slur ""mudslime"", which is a deliberate attempt to offend. This term is equivalent to other slurs like 'kike', 'beaner', or 'chink'. Its usage targets an entire religious group and perpetuates ethnic stereotypes.

The text describes the user getting their parents to watch a queer-themed TV show called Queer Eye and that now they are obsessed with gay culture. The use of emojis at the end suggests the post is meant in a lighthearted, humorous tone.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- Referring to a popular LGBTQ+ themed show 
- Mentioning parents becoming ""obsessed"" with the show
- Use of celebratory emojis

The target group appears to be LGBTQ+ individuals. However, rather than targeting them negatively, the post portrays the user's efforts in exposing their parents positively as something accomplished.

The text is classified as normal because it does not contain any controversial or offensive content. It expresses a common sentiment of dissatisfaction with one's appearance rather than targeting any specific group.

Key features that support this classification:
- The absence of derogatory terms or targeted language. 
- A general statement about skin and appearance, lacking references to race, religion, or other identity.
- No clear context of hate speech or malice.

Impact on the target audience is negligible due to the lack of specificity. While it may be seen as a negative sentiment, this relates to the speaker's self-image rather than any particular group.

Tone: The casual language and use of vulgarity in a lighthearted manner suggests the intent is more humorous/self-deprecating rather than hateful or bigoted.

In conclusion, the text does not exhibit characteristics typical of hate speech or offensive material due to its absence of targeted language, general sentimentality, self-referential nature, and overall neutral tone. It can be seen as a normal post without harmfully discriminatory intent.

Label Implication: The text is classified as offensive due to its mocking and dismissive tone towards the Jewish faith and its historical period of significance.

Key Features:
- ""Antiquity period"" refers to a time in history, but with an error (""was are not you"") that implies ignorance or ridicule.
- ""Hahaha"", ""pmsl"", and ""kike"" are used as dismissive laughing expressions.

Target: The Jewish faith is targeted by the tweet's tone of mocking and dismissiveness towards their historical period.

Context/Tone: The tone is light and casual, but still conveys a sense of superiority and belittling of the target group. This context supports an offensive classification.

Conclusion:
The text makes a derogatory reference to the antiquity period and the Jewish faith through its error and mocking tone. Its key features (""hahaha"", ""pmsl"", ""kike"") support this as well.

- 'Dykes' is also a derogatory slur aimed at homosexuals.

The tone and intent behind using these words is clearly to offend and demean the referenced groups - women, Africans, and homosexuals. The casual use of such language normalizes harmful stereotypes and perpetuates prejudice.

Additionally, the emojis used convey an element of mocking and ridicule towards the people being referenced.

Key features that support this classification include:
- The lack of targeted slurs, derogatory terms, or discriminatory references.
- An innocuous and inquiring tone rather than an aggressive or disparaging one.

The text does not seem to target any specific group, making ""None"" a suitable selection for the target. There is no context suggesting harm or malice towards a racial, religious, sexual, or other minority group.

- The impersonal, analytical nature of the statement (""might be indicative"", ""lack of"") 
- The inclusion of potential reasons for the prevalence of white male characters

The text does not contain offensive content or targeting language to any specific group. It instead offers an observation and possible explanation while avoiding inflammatory tone.

Context: While discussing a sensitive topic like racial representation, the text refrains from generalizing, stereotyping or perpetuating hate. The neutral language and focus on research over discrimination justify its normal classification.

In conclusion, this text is classified as normal due to its non-judgmental analysis and objective discussion of demographics in film without targeting any group with offensive language or tone.",15.11

Key points:
- The message is political in nature but lacks derogatory language targeting a specific group. 
- It expresses frustration at voter turnout without using slurs, epithets, or stereotypes to blame women or Democrats.
- The tone is critical and dismissive of lazy voters but this tone does not constitute hate speech.
- There are no key features that support an offensive classification as it does not target or demean a group based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc.

In conclusion, while the language may be provocative in a political sense by blaming certain groups for low voter turnout, it does not cross the threshold of hate speech. The tweet's tone is negative but general in its criticism without explicit slurs or stereotypes aimed at a racial/religious group.

- No use of explicit hate speech terms like ""beaner"" 
- The reference to putting someone in their place is non-specific
- There are no clear ethnic, religious or disabled references

The target audience is not clearly specified but none are mentioned either. Therefore, there doesn't appear to be any intent to offend a specific group.

- Lack of explicit derogatory language 
- No apparent intent to demean or offend a specific group
- Focus on geopolitical scenarios rather than hate speech

The tweet text is classified as normal because it does not contain any hate speech or offensive content targeting a specific group. The language used has sexual connotations but in the context of an intimate relationship rather than to perpetuate harm towards a particular race, religion, gender identity, etc.

Key features that support this classification:
- No use of derogatory terms or discriminatory slurs
- No promotion of violence or harm against a protected class (race, religion, gender, etc.)
- The language used is sexual but in the context of intimacy and desire rather than to offend

The target group referenced is not being targeted with hate speech or offensive content. Rather, the tweet appears to be an expression of desire from one person to another.

In terms of context and tone, there is no malicious intent to cause harm to a particular group. The sexual language is used in a relationship rather than to offend.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the classification as a normal text is justified due to its lack of hate speech, discriminatory slurs or promotion of harm towards any protected class despite having sexual content.",14.91

This text is classified as hate speech due to its derogatory language targeting ethnic and religious groups. The usage of the n-word, a well-known racial slur, in conjunction with an anti-Semitic remark categorizes this as hate speech.

The key features ""nigger"" and ""Jew"" are explicit slurs used to dehumanize individuals based on their race or religion respectively. Their combination and placement at the end of the sentence emphasizes the malicious intent behind this tweet.

This hate speech targets African Americans and Jewish people, referencing two historically persecuted groups with a history of being demeaned by such language. The casual nature in which these terms are used to express disdain for an entire group exemplifies the harmful ideology promoted here.

The tone is clearly derogatory rather than neutral or satirical, leaving little doubt that this qualifies as hate speech meant to offend and discriminate against the referenced groups based on their protected characteristics.

In conclusion, this text's blatant use of racial slurs, coupled with its discriminatory intent towards ethnic and religious minorities, classifies it definitively as hate speech.",15.01

2. Absence of discriminatory terms and targeting of groups: The text does not single out any race, religion, sexual orientation, etc., with harmful stereotypes, epithets, or generalizations. 

3. General tone without aggression or malice: The conversational style, including the emoticon representation of a laughing face, suggests an unproblematic, lighthearted tone.

4. Non-problematic content and non-derogatory language: The text does not contain any content or language that could be considered inappropriate, derogatory, or offensive towards any individual(s).

The text explicitly lists off these offensive labels as if to establish a person's potential identity, implying exclusion or prejudice against them. 
Its derogatory nature and targeting of ethnic minorities in a disparaging manner qualifies this as hate speech.

- Alternatively, the text could be seen as simply listing various ethnicities without hate intent - but the slurs used are undeniably offensive and targeting specific groups. This classifies it as hate speech rather than just an innocent list.

- It uses the derogatory term ""niglet"" to refer to a child with a racial minority background. This racist slur and the suggestion of adoption by the speaker targets African people.
- The tweet contains vulgar language such as ""fucking"" in order to offend and provoke.
- The reference to ""blank slate theory"" combined with the call for the user to adopt children from a minority group is a veiled threat.

Taken together, these features - the slur, vulgarity, and veiled threat towards an ethnic group when combined with the context of adoption - classify this as hate speech. The tone and intent are clearly disparaging and targeting a racial minority group.
The classification is justified by the text's clear violations of ethical standards for language use in its slurs, swearing, and veiled threats.

The text's intent appears to be spreading hate by invoking derogatory language against the Jewish community. This cannot be justified as a neutral comment and instead falls into the category of hate speech due to its clear anti-Semitic nature.

- The phrase's implication that these individuals should go live with their ""cousins"" (a misspelling of cousins) suggests segregation and separation.

Target:
The text targets African people or those perceived as having darker skin, using a racial slur to demean them. This language targets an entire ethnic group.

Context & tone: 
The tone is derogatory, discriminatory, and hateful. The user's intent appears to be racist and harmful, perpetuating stereotypes about individuals based on their race. There is no attempt at humor or irony; this is a direct attack on a targeted minority group.

In conclusion, due to the use of a racial slur with clear discriminatory intent targeting an ethnic minority, alongside the segregatory language suggesting they go ""live"" somewhere else, this text definitively qualifies as hate speech aimed at harming and demeaning African people or those perceived as having darker skin.

- Classification implies this text does not contain controversial or targeted language. 
- The tone comes across as dismissive and annoyed with the implication that the speaker is uninterested in engaging with the question posed.

In conclusion, while a derogatory expletive ""fuck"" is used, its usage here appears more as a figure of speech expressing annoyance than a hate term targeting any group. The text does not contain any ethnic or religious slurs, and references an economic issue without discriminatory language.

Given this analysis, the classification of normal makes sense as it lacks explicit controversial content or targeted language aimed at specific groups. While the expletive ""fuck"" is used, its context here is more conversational than harmful.

- While the subject matter is controversial, the overall tone lacks harm and discriminatory intent.

In conclusion, while the topic may be sensitive, the lack of derogatory language and absence of targeted malice justify its classification as a normal post. The tone suggests humor over hate speech.",9.11

Key factors supporting this classification include:

1) The use of the n-word, a slur that targets African-Americans and perpetuates historical oppression. Its usage, especially in this context, categorizes this as hate speech.

2) The reference to ""old white ladies"" also targets another demographic group with derogatory language.

3) The implication is that the speaker's hair was subject to invasive questions from white women, an uncomfortable situation often faced by Black people. This racial tension is exacerbated by the slur and tone used.

4) The intent appears to be mocking and dehumanizing based on the profanity used (""tf""), implying a desire for harm or disrespect towards these groups.

In conclusion, the explicit slurs, targeted insults, and apparent disregard for human dignity make this text an example of hate speech. Its derogatory language and tone are profoundly offensive and harmful, especially when directed at already vulnerable groups like Black women and elderly white women. This type of dehumanizing speech is inherently hateful based on both its content and intent.",14.43

While slavery was legal until it was outlawed, the speaker acknowledges that both practices were morally wrong. The text avoids hate speech or offensive language.

The key features are the comparisons of the Holocaust and slavery to make a point about their immorality despite being legally permissible at times. These do not support hate speech or offend any group. 

As the target is a Jewish group, the comparison could be seen as insensitive in its reference to the Holocaust, but the context does not show malice or intent to offend.

The tone is conversational and appears more focused on the immorality of both practices rather than targeting a group. The speaker concludes that slavery was wrong even if legal at times.

In conclusion, while the comparison may be seen as insensitive by some, the text lacks derogatory language and targeted offense in its discussion of historical practices' morality. It does not categorize as hate speech or offensive due to its academic tone without harmfully referencing a group.

- Key features supporting this classification include the lack of derogatory slurs, threats, or inciteful content. 
- While the target group mentioned is Jewish, there is no explicit bigotry or stereotyping.
- However, the mention of ""pedo thing"" implies inappropriate activity and the use of ""shapeshifters"" could be seen as an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. 
- The tone seems to be discussing something remembered rather than an intent to offend/harm.
- In conclusion, while this text has problematic undertones, it doesn't rise to hate speech or explicit bigotry in the context presented. It is normal but still somewhat offensive/off-putting in its implications and language used.

Alternatively, this could be classified as offensive for perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes even if not directly targeted at a group. The shapeshifter accusation is a conspiracy theory often used against Jews. To fully justify a neutral label, the text should avoid such undertones entirely. As it stands, the implication of these theories and slurs, while perhaps in passing, still merits an offensive classification to some degree.

However, as no outright hate speech, this would not rise to that level despite being problematic. I would lean toward an offensive classification for this post given its implications and language used even if not explicitly hateful. The undertones are still troublesome.",18.53

- The reference to a streamer known for doxxing, a serious offense involving privacy violation and real-life threats, further supports the classification as an endorsement of harmful actions.

The intent behind this tweet appears to be a justification or rationalization of white people's use of the n-word and its presumed acceptance from black people. This is harmful hate speech as it disregards the agency and choice of the targeted group and aims to normalize such offensive language.

This tweet is classified as normal despite targeting an individual (Seb Gorka) with accusations of treason. The call for deportation and labeling Seb Gorka a white supremacist spreading violence are not hate speech but rather political opposition expressed in strong terms.

The target is Seb Gorka, who the user believes has engaged in treasonous activities supporting white supremacy and inciting violence. This is the key feature - an accusation of a serious crime.

However, without explicit derogatory language or incitements to harm, this is not hate speech but political opposition. The intent appears to be critique rather than harm. The tone is harsh but not abusive, so it does not qualify as offensive either.

In summary, while the accusations against Seb Gorka are severe and the call for deportation is strong, there is no hate speech or abuse in this post itself, so it remains a normal expression of political opinion targeting an individual with whom the user strongly disagrees.",13.1

This tweet is classified as hate speech for several reasons:

1. The use of explicit language like ""fucking"" and slurs such as ""chimp"" and ""dindu nigger"" to target and demean the person's identity, especially using a term that degrades someone's race or ethnicity.

2. The comparison between the person being addressed and an animal, implying they are less intelligent or have lower mental capabilities than a chimpanzee. This is an offensive analogy.

3. Targeting a specific group such as Indians and Africans using derogatory terms indicates malicious intent and harm against that demographic.

4. The context of insulting the person's name, intelligence and identity while using hate speech slurs makes this not just a general attack but one aimed at their race and background.

Summary: The tweet uses the derogatory term ""kike"" to refer to a person of Jewish descent, and praises someone for sympathizing with or defending this individual. This is a direct attack on Jewish people through hate speech.

Key Features:
- Usage of the slur ""kike"", which has been used historically as an anti-Semitic epithet 
- The implication that it takes bravery to support someone from this group
- The tone of the post implies solidarity between the original person and the sympathizer in spite of being ""brave"" enough to stand up for a Jewish individual

Target:
The post is directed at Jewish people, using language that disparages and degrades them. The slur employed has been used extensively as an anti-Semitic taunt.

Tone and Intent: 
Rather than condemning or reprimanding the Jewish sympathizer, the author of this tweet chooses to praise them for their ""bravery"". This reveals an intent to provoke through hate speech and anti-Semitism rather than condemn it.

Conclusion:
The use of a well-known anti-Semitic slur combined with praising someone for standing up for a Jewish individual establishes that this post is an act of hate speech targeting the Jewish community.

The target, Hispanic refugees, are disparaged through the use of dehumanizing language which denies them dignity and respect. This term has been associated with hate groups to demean the targeted minority.

While Trump is also referenced, the offensive nature of this tweet is amplified by the slur directed at Hispanic refugees. The intent appears to be divisive, as it reduces a group to an insulting stereotype while invoking Trump divisively.

Summary:
The text is classified as hate speech due to its derogatory and discriminatory content targeting an ethnic and religious minority group. Key features include the slur ""muzzie"" used to disparage Muslims or those of Middle Eastern descent, along with the immigrant status being highlighted.

Impact on target:
- The tweet directly targets Arabs, Muslims, Iranians, and refugees/immigrants.
- The perpetrator is identified as a ""muzzie"" and an immigrant from Iran in a negative context.

Intent:
- Tone is derogatory and discriminatory. The slur used to identify the shooter's ethnicity/religion aims to dehumanize them.
- Context of violent incident emphasizes their guilt by highlighting their minority status.

Conclusion: 
This tweet's explicit targeting of a religious/ethnic group using hate speech, in addition to its negative context ascribing culpability for a shooting incident, categorizes it as hate speech. The slur ""muzzie"" and emphasis on immigration status contribute to the discrimination against Muslims/Iranians targeted here.",14.1

The term 'beaner' is a racial slur commonly used against people of Mexican descent or those assumed to be Latin American. It is accompanied by the implication that an individual won a ""diversity lottery"" due to their race rather than merit, perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

The key feature of using this pejorative term directly targets and disparages a specific group, Hispanics and refugees, in a derogatory manner. This hate speech has clear intent to offend or slur these minorities through name-calling and false accusations of affirmative action fraud.

In conclusion, the text is categorized as hate speech due to its use of an ethnic slur that directly harms a group with racist intent. The tone and key features clearly place this in the hate speech category rather than a more general offensive label due to their direct targeting of a racial minority group with clear malice.",13.23

Key features do not support any specific category.

Discussion:
The key feature list appears empty, suggesting no notable keywords that would classify this as hate speech or even remotely offensive. The tweet's content focuses on expressing a preference for men with D-cup breasts in a sexual context, but this language and imagery is not directed at any group to offend or target them. 

Targeted groups are listed as African and Men. While the term ""niggas"" may be seen as derogatory towards African people, its use here appears within the context of a sexual preference rather than hate speech targeting that race. The term 'men' is targeted but not in an offensive manner.

Tone seems more lustful than malicious or harmful to any group. Intent does not appear hateful but rather sexually appreciative. 

In conclusion, this text lacks the necessary features and intent to be classified as hate speech or even mildly offensive. Its sexual nature does not target any group with malice, making it a normal classification based on the analysis of its content and purpose.

2. Key features support this classification because there are no hate speech, discriminatory terms, sensitive topics, or targeted language in the tweet. It only states an opinion without offense.

3. Target group: There is no identifiable target that could take offense from this general opinion about Eminem. The text does not reference any specific group to derigrate.

4. Context and tone: The language used appears to be appreciative of Eminem's music based on personal criteria unrelated to divisive factors like race. This tone is casual rather than aggressive.

5. Conclusion: In summary, the classification of this tweet as normal is justified because it lacks hate speech, targeted terms, or a derogatory context that could offend any group.

The text is offensive because it makes a reference to the Holocaust while excluding Jewish victims. The mention of ""every victim"" except one specific group is an omission that trivializes their experience and suffering during this genocide.

Key points:
- Excluding Jewish victims in a discussion of the Holocaust perpetuates harm towards them.
- Downplaying or omitting any ethnic minority's role in such a tragedy has offensive implications.

The reference to the Holocaust without including the primary targeted group, Jewish people, is offensive. The exclusion sends a message that their experience during the genocide is insignificant compared to other victims. This trivialization and omission of their suffering categorizes this text as offensive due to how it targets and diminishes an ethnic minority's role in such an event.

The intent appears to be an ignorant or malicious omission rather than simply being neutral. The specific exclusion of Jewish victims and the historical context make this more than a harmless comment about food preferences, classifying this as an offensive statement targeting an ethnic group through a genocide reference.",13.44

The target groups are clearly African Americans (through the slur ""nigger"") and homosexuals (via the derogatory term ""faggot""). These are historically oppressed groups that face discrimination, making language like this especially harmful. 

The intent is plainly malicious with the use of hate speech to dehumanize these groups through sexual violence. There's no context or tone to justify its usage.

The usage of this derogatory slur and other divisive rhetoric contributes to the hate speech label, as it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and targets a religious minority with malicious intent. The tone also appears hostile and dismissive towards the targeted group.

- The tweet discusses the inconvenience of losing airpod earbuds at an unspecified interval.

2. Key features like ""yid666"", ""created islam"", and repeated references to ""yid"" (an anti-Semitic slur) clearly target Jewish people in an inflammatory manner, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and hate speech.

3. The text makes outrageous claims about the origin of Islam as created by a Jewish person named Yid666, with his older wife being Jewish. This targets Muslims based on their faith and also spews vitriolic hatred towards Jewish people.

4. Even more disturbing is the vile sexual allegation that Aisha was a young Jewish slave and child bride of Muhammad's. The mention of schizophrenia, pedophilia and slavery paints both Islam and Jews in the most negative light possible, fueling religious discrimination and hate.

5. In conclusion, this post is filled with hate speech targeting Muslims and Jews based on their religion.

2) Sexualized imagery used to demean the target group further, implying submissive acts without consent. This dehumanizes and exploits the targeted race for shock value.

Summary:
This tweet is classified as hate speech due to its derogatory targeting of African Americans and women. Key points include the use of a racist slur against an African American woman and the implication that it would be acceptable for the user to wear a shirt with an offensive message.

Key Features:
- The term ""negress"" is a derogatory epithet aimed at an African American woman, specifically targeting her race.
- The reference to obesity (""obese"") in addition to the slur dehumanizes and mocks the woman's appearance.

Target Group:
The tweet directly targets and disparages African Americans and women. This compounds the harm as it attacks both racial and gender groups.

Tone and Intent:
The user clearly intends to offend with their message, making a comparison to wearing an ""it okay to be white"" shirt while describing a black woman's shirt as offensive. The inflammatory language combined with this double standard makes this a deliberate attack on targeted groups.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the use of a racist slur targeting African Americans and women, coupled with dehumanizing comments about appearance, firmly categorizes this as hate speech. The user's intent to offend these groups through their message warrants this classification based on its explicit targeting of race and gender.",21.09

- Key features are absent since there's no controversial language used.
- No target group is mentioned except for the neutral reference to Trump supporters, not in an offensive manner.
- The tone appears informative rather than hateful or abusive.
- In conclusion, this text provides factual details without promoting hate speech or offensive content towards any group. Its neutrality makes it a normal classification with no harm posed.

Example analyses:
1. **Hate Speech**: 
   - tweet_text: ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her.""
   - Key points include discriminatory terms and the sensitive context, targeting racial, religious, and disabled groups. The usage of derogatory language in describing an ethnic minority and religious group in a negative incident categorizes this as hate speech.

2. **Offensive**: 
    - tweet_text: ""as much as i appreciate a format of open discussion i really just want a facebook that i can say beaner on?""
    - The term ""beaner"" is a derogatory slur used to target individuals of Mexican descent. Its use in the tweet trivializes the harm caused by such language and perpetuates ethnic stereotypes.
    - This tweet is classified as offensive due to its use of explicit derogatory language aimed at a specific ethnic group.

3. **Neutral**: 
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - This lacks controversial content or targeted language, making it neutral. The friendly tone and general nature affirm its classification, posing no harm or offense to any group.

- No discriminatory slurs or profanity are used to describe the target group.

Target: 
The text does not contain hate speech targeting any racial or ethnic groups. It merely expresses a personal experience of feeling unsafe without using derogatory language.

Context & Tone:
The tone seems anxious and uneasy rather than malicious or bigoted. The user shares their discomfort in an alcohol-fueled situation with a group of white people but avoids expressing hatred or using offensive language.

The text describes a situation where someone invoked a legal doctrine to justify indiscriminate white violence against black people. This is framed as being too obvious or on the nose.

Key features include the reference to the castle doctrine (a legal justification for using force against intruders) and the description of indiscriminate race-based violence. However, this is not presented in an offensive manner but rather as a straightforward statement with no derogatory language.

The target group appears to be black people in general, though the tone does not seem intent on causing harm or offense. Rather, it's a factual description without overtly negative connotation.

The target group referenced are Caucasian women in general, with no direct name-calling of individuals. However, the sexually charged advice to avoid marrying a white woman is inappropriate.

The tone and context seem to be a flippant comment between friends rather than hateful rhetoric. Intent appears more casual than malicious.

In summary, while this language may be seen as offensive by some due to its sexual nature, it does not rise to hate speech or offense due to the absence of discriminatory slurs or inciting language towards an audience.",11.31

- The slur used is an explicit derogatory term.
- It targets a specific racial/ethnic minority group (Arab/Pakistani).
- Its usage in the context of an innocent situation (""had not seen the old woman"") amplifies the offensiveness.

Context & Intent:
The text's intent appears to be perpetuating ethnic stereotypes and slurs. The slur used is clearly derogatory, aiming to offend or demean the targeted group.

The tone and intent is hostile, with the implication being that this person's behavior is threatening because she is a black lesbian stalker towards white women.

Key features include the user's self-reference and intent to create a painting featuring facial hair. The mention of being able to count ""to potato"" implies an innocent or immature tone, further supporting the normal classification.

There is no target group singled out for discrimination or offense in this post, which was one key consideration for its neutral categorization.

The user's intention appears to be self-expression and sharing their artistic plans rather than causing harm. Their statement of being able to paint and shave does not contain any provocative language aimed at a specific religion, nationality, or group.

In conclusion, the text is normal due to its inoffensive content, lack of discriminatory language, self-referential nature, and innocent tone while discussing art. None of the key features support hate speech or offensive categories.",11.74

1. The use of the derogatory slur ""nigger"". This is a well-known, highly offensive term used to target and demean people of African descent. Its usage immediately categorizes this as an offensive statement.

2. The lack of any mitigating context to suggest this was used in a non-pejorative manner. Without such context to justify its use, it can only be seen as a malicious attack on the targeted ethnic group.

3. The intent behind using such language seems clear - to offend and demean. There is no apparent attempt at an innocently curious or neutral usage of the term, further solidifying the classification.

4. The targeting of Africans with this slur perpetuates long-standing racial stereotypes and hate speech towards African people. Such references are known to be extremely offensive.

In conclusion, all key features point towards categorizing this tweet as highly offensive due to its use of a notorious ethnic slur in a clearly malicious context aimed at an audience it targets. Its intent is unmistakable - to offend the targeted group with harmful language. As such, I can only classify this text as deeply offensive hate speech.",15.36

The key features of ""muzrat"" and ""invasions"" are clearly used in a derogatory manner to describe the invasion of these groups. The term ""muzrat"" is likely a misspelling/intentional alteration of ""Muslim"" with an offensive undertone and the implication of the person being of a low IQ or unintelligent manner. This term has been used by some as a pejorative for Muslim or Arab individuals.

The context of gun bans leading to ""muzrat invasions"" and government overthrows is also highly inflammatory, targeting these groups as a threat. It perpetuates harmful stereotypes and promotes hostile attitudes towards them.

The tone is one of fearmongering and Islamophobia, painting Muslims in an extremely negative light while invoking imagery of violent invasion and overthrow. This is deeply offensive to the target audience and contributes to harmful generalizations about Arab, Muslim or refugee individuals.

In conclusion, the use of derogatory language with clear targeting towards a specific ethnic/religious group in the context of fear-inducing threats justifies this classification as an offensive tweet.

- This offensive slur is a key feature targeting the Jewish community. Its usage perpetuates harmful stereotypes and ethnic discrimination.
- By associating incompetence with this group, the intent behind using such language targets Jews in general.
- The inflammatory tone and the call for someone to be ""sent packing"" solely due to their perceived political views or presumed ethnicity affirms that this is a hate speech incident.

The classification of this tweet as ""normal"" is a bit questionable given its use of controversial language and the context in which it's used. Here are some key points that could lead to an alternative classification:

- The term ""nigga"" has a complex history and multiple connotations depending on who uses it and how. In this case, with no additional context, it is difficult to ascertain whether it is being used as an endearment or an insult.

- The phrase ""wanna follow me on the gram"" implies that someone is attempting to follow them on Instagram rather than expressing a genuine interest in their presence.

- The use of the term ""goofy ass nigga"" has a condescending tone and may be interpreted as mocking or insulting.

- If we take this as hate speech, it would be because of the slur usage even if used casually. The intent seems to be trivializing rather than inciting violence.

In conclusion, while there is controversy in the classification due to language use, without more context, the tone doesn't seem malicious enough for hate speech or a clear derogation towards a racial group as they themselves are African. The term usage may still be seen as offensive but the intent appears to be casual rather than a targeted attack.",20.31

Summary:
The text is classified as hate speech due to the usage of a derogatory ethnic slur (""Paki"") combined with degrading and offensive language targeting individuals of Arab or Indigenous descent. Key features include using the term ""dirty"", ""filthy"", and ""smelly"" to describe members of this group, alongside the vulgar misogynistic insult ""cunts.""

Targeted Group:
The tweet directly targets people of Arab or Indigenous ethnic origin, as well as making a broader reference to other non-white groups. It is meant to offend these individuals through racist slurs and dehumanizing language.

Tone & Context:  
The post has an entirely malicious tone, calling for hate speech to be directed at the targeted group. There is no context to justify or defend such a vile remark; it is simply perpetuating harmful stereotypes and abuse.

3. The context of wanting America to go to war with Iran, instigated by Jews, shows the user's intent is divisive and hostile towards these religious groups.

4. The mention of not having ""a truly good night sleep"" until these groups are neutered indicates a strong hatred and intolerance for them.

- The intent seems to be inciting harm and violence against this target group by using inflammatory rhetoric like ""send them back"" in an aggressive manner.
- Overall, the text perpetuates violent stereotypes and expresses a clear animus towards Africans, justifying its hate speech label.

**Offensive**
- While not rising to hate speech level, this tweet is still extremely offensive due to its usage of the slur ""beaner"". 
- The term has strong ethnic connotations and is used in an insensitive manner without regard for harm caused.
- Its inclusion alongside trivializing language like ""i really just want a facebook"" downplays the offense and stereotyping towards Mexicans.

1. The label implies that the text does not contain hate speech or offensive content targeting a specific group.
2. Key features are not provided in this case. Typically, key features point to language, references, or actions that support either a hate speech or offensive classification.
3. The target of ""Arab"" suggests an Arab or Arabic-speaking person/group is mentioned. However, the text does not contain derogatory language or a harmful message toward Arabs.
4. The tone and context appear casual rather than malicious or aggressive. The mention of ""towelhead"" likely refers to a headscarf commonly worn by some Arab individuals. Its usage here lacks the intent to offend or dehumanize that would be characteristic of hate speech.
5. In conclusion, while the term used in this post is sometimes associated with derogatory language against Arabs, its application appears more playful and harmless than hateful based on context and lack of accompanying offensive elements.

This tweet is classified as hate speech due to its explicit use of a racial slur and derogatory language. 

The term ""nigger"" is a highly offensive and discriminatory word used to denigrate people of African descent. Its usage here, combined with the description of racial discrimination, makes this tweet an overt example of hate speech targeting a specific ethnic group.

Additionally, the comparison to Rosa Parks, an icon for overcoming racial barriers, in such a negative light trivializes both her accomplishments and the struggles still faced by Black people. This adds to the harm and offense caused by this hateful message.

The tone is one of mockery rather than remorse or awareness. The use of emojis like 🤣 further reduces the severity of the slur, implying it was used for humorous effect which actually perpetuates the harm done to African people by such slurs.

- The tone is one of ridicule, with the mocking repetitions of ""lolololololol"" to further demean and disrespect the target group's beliefs.
- In conclusion, this tweet exemplifies hate speech through its use of explicit slurs and gendered insults to offend Muslims.",10.13

The context of putting the code up to expose someone's actions to public humiliation while using such offensive language further supports its classification. The user has clearly targeted Jewish people with abusive slurs and perpetuated anti-Semitic stereotypes, making this text meet criteria for hate speech towards an ethnically or religiously defined group in a disparaging manner.",10.6

Key features include the usage of the n-word, which is one of the most offensive racial slurs in modern society. This word has an extensive history of being used to dehumanize, degrade, and subjugate Black people.

The target group is clearly African due to the direct reference to this slur. The text's tone is not apologetic or critical of using such language - it instead seems to justify or even encourage the usage of the n-word under certain circumstances. This perpetuates racist attitudes that devalue the humanity and dignity of Black individuals.

The context implies an acceptance, if not encouragement, of hate speech against a protected group based on race. The overall message appears to be one of discriminatory approval rather than condemnation for using such slurs.

In conclusion, due to the text's clear targeting of African people through one of society's most offensive words, while lacking any contrition or disapproval, it can only be classified as hate speech that seeks to harm and degrade a racial minority. Its usage of an egregious slur makes this categorization justified based on the analysis of its content, context, and tone.

This response follows the framework by:
1. Summarizing the label's implication for the text
2. Discussing key features like the n-word
3. Evaluating the target group (African people)
4. Assessing the text's overall hateful tone

This tweet is classified as hate speech due to the use of a derogatory term (""raghead"") aimed at an Arab or Middle Eastern individual/group. The pejorative term is a slur that perpetuates harmful stereotypes and discrimination against Muslims/Arabs.

The key feature supporting this classification is the explicit usage of ""raghead"", which has clear connotations targeting Arabs/Muslims with the intent to demean/degrade. This is further emphasized by how it's used as a racial slur in the context of referring to someone's appearance.

As a hate speech label, the post is meant to offend and insult based on race/ethnicity. It perpetuates stereotypes and discrimination against Arab Muslims. The derogatory term alone is enough to classify this as hate speech aimed at that group. 

In conclusion, the usage of ""raghead"" with its clear discriminatory intent makes this a textbook example of hate speech targeting Arabs/Muslims. Its offensiveness coupled with the slur's notorious connotations leads to its classification as hate speech aimed at an ethnic/religious minority.

The key points are:
- Usage of derogatory term ""raghead""
- Clear discriminatory intent/targeting
- Perpetuating stereotypes against Arabs/Muslims

3. Using a derogatory slur like ""nigger"" is highly offensive, especially when combined with gendered language and a specific race being mentioned.

- The context discusses a Syrian refugee studying politics, which they see as trying to further an alleged Muslim cause that threatens British rule.
- Overall, this post perpetuates harmful stereotypes against ethnic and religious minorities while advocating for their cleansing. It incites hatred with its violent rhetoric towards the target groups.

**Normal**: 
- This post lacks any controversial or violent content, making it a normal neutral statement. It doesn't target any group or contain hate speech/offensive language.
- Key features don't include slurs like ""moslem"", ""scum"" or calls for violence against targeted groups.
- The context isn't discriminatory and doesn't perpetuate stereotypes of ethnic/religious minorities while advocating harm.

The tone has a clear intent to offend and disparage the target group, aiming to provoke hate. There is no context or alternative explanation that would justify this as simply offensive or neutral speech. The derogatory slur combined with the false accusations makes this unmistakably an act of hate speech targeting Jewish people.

Explanation:
- The text targets Muslims by implying harm towards them in an unspecified ""Moslem Country"".
- Key features like the phrase ""moslem country"" and the context of ""illegal entry"" causing undefined consequences to Moslems contribute to its offensive nature.
- The tone seems to seek violence or harm against Muslims as a group, based on an illegal act. 
- While not hate speech due to the lack of overtly discriminatory language, this is still deeply offensive in targeting a religious minority and implying harm.

- The tone does not seem malicious, as unicorns are often associated with myth and wonder rather than harm. This lack of intent for real violence in this phrasing keeps it from being categorized as offensive.

3. The text directly addresses and distinguishes between two groups - gay individuals (""r cool"") and gay individuals using a derogatory slur (""r not""). This makes the target of the hate speech LGBQ individuals, aiming to disparage them through language.

- Referring to homosexuals with the disparaging term ""queers.""

The text contains several key features and language that directly target specific ethnic and religious groups in a derogatory manner. 

- The usage of terms like ""wetback"" and ""muzzee"" are explicit slurs aimed at Hispanic and Muslim communities respectively.
- Mentioning ""black violence"" perpetuates harmful stereotypes against African Americans.
- The repetition of ""violence"" creates an aggressive, threatening tone.

The combination of these factors with their direct targeting of minority groups places this text firmly in the category of hate speech. It seeks to demean specific racial and religious groups through slurs while implying dangerous behavior. The overall message is one of hostility and prejudice.

While the tone may seem strong in criticizing those who believe Trump is innocent, the language used does not contain derogatory slurs or hate speech.

The key point is that the vitriolic criticism of Trump supporters is not categorizing this as hate speech because it doesn't target an identifiable group based on race, religion, etc. rather than political beliefs. The recommendation to read the White House memo for evidence also suggests a basis in fact rather than pure bigotry.

- Derogatory terms like ""rabid"", ""inbred"" and ""shithole"" used to disparage Pakistanis 
- Reference to a group's religion (""sullahs"")
- Fear-mongering about living in the UK
The tone is one of vitriol hate aimed at the Pakistani people, with the intent to dehumanize them. The use of such language perpetuates harm and hate towards an ethnic minority.
This text has a significant negative impact by contributing to hostile stereotypes against Pakistanis and Muslims. The context around Tommy's arrest does not justify this xenophobic response.

In conclusion, based on the offensive language used targeting an entire religious/ethnic group with clear malice and hate speech intent, this tweet is classified as hate speech.",12.29

The tone is openly hostile, with clear intent to offend and disparage. The mention of an affordable wedding being a ""cheap ass"" event implies the user believes they are beneath having a proper ceremony. Overall, this hate speech targets both women and Hispanics with explicit slurs and derogatory language.

Key features:
- The slur ""Yid"" is an anti-Semitic slur used to denigrate individuals of Jewish descent.
- There are no mitigating or explanatory context; its sole purpose is to offend Jews.

Target group: 
The text explicitly targets the Jewish community, using a term with a history of offensive anti-Semitism. This is a clear attack on a specific religious and ethnic minority.

Intent:
There is no benign intent behind using this slur. It's employed for the purpose of offense and harassment towards Jews. The tone is hostile and derogatory.

In conclusion, the text directly targets Jewish people with an abusive term known to offend them. Its singular purpose is hate, making it a prime example of hate speech aimed at persecuting Jews. The features and context justify this classification.",11.9

Key features like ""jews,"" ""nigz,"" and ""muzzies"" are slurs directed at Jews, Africans (blacks), and Muslims (Mozzies). The lack of context to soften these words means they are being used as hate speech. 

The target groups mentioned in the key features - African, Arab, Islam - are all minorities that have historically faced prejudice and discrimination. The text specifically singles them out for ridicule.

The tone is clearly derogatory rather than satirical or innocently curious, given the explicit use of well-known slurs with a clear intent to offend. This implies the user intends harm towards these groups.

Additionally, the user's accusatory tone towards another person for ""making up"" this topic suggests their malicious intent in targeting Africans with such language.

Furthermore, the generalizing statement about all women being stupid and ungrateful is a grossly inaccurate and degrading stereotype. This language contributes to the objectification and belittling of an entire gender.

The key features of the slur ""nigger"" and the epithet ""stupid"" are used to demean and disparage the target group, African people. The usage of such language, especially in combination with a qualifier like ""stupid"", is an explicit attack on their intelligence and humanity.

Moreover, the text targets African individuals, implying that they lack the capability to lead or make decisions. This promotes harmful stereotypes and perpetuates systemic discrimination against black people.

The tone of the post is also hateful and demeaning. Rather than expressing a disagreement with someone's actions, it uses an explicit slur to dehumanize them based on their race. The casual nature of its use makes it even more concerning.

In conclusion, the text can be unequivocally classified as hate speech. It directly targets and attacks the dignity of African individuals using egregious slurs in a demeaning way with clear malicious intent. As such, this post is an unacceptable violation of human rights and norms.",15.3

- The text has a casual, conversational tone that doesn't promote harm. It appears more as a statement of opinion rather than hate speech or offensive language.

As such language perpetuates harmful stereotypes and targets an entire racial category, its use in the context of this post contributes to a classification as offensive. The term's meaning and history support that it was chosen for that impact.

The intent appears to be insulting and demeaning based on race, which aligns with the definition of hate speech or offensive content. However, the classification here is more broad - simply aiming to offend without fully committing harmful acts or inciting violence.

In summary, this post is classified as offensive because it utilizes a derogatory term in an ethnic slur's context and targets an entire racial group for ridicule. The key features support that intent and meaning behind using such language.",11.52

The classification of this text as offensive is supported by several key factors:

1. The use of discriminatory terms targeting African and women. Words like niggress are derogatory slurs aimed at a specific race and gender.

2. The trivialization of these harmful labels in a demeaning manner, implying Joy Reid's intelligence or credibility based on her identity rather than facts. This perpetuates stereotypes.

3. The context implies she is a ""nigress"" for not knowing what hacking means, further degrading and mocking her as an African woman who lacks technical knowledge.

The tone of the tweet overall appears to be disparaging and insulting towards Reid as an African female figure. The explicit language targets both race and gender. 

While hate speech may have been considered due to the clear slurs and demeaning context, this is classified offensive rather than hate speech because it doesn't necessarily incite violence or harm but aims to offend.

This tweet does not contain any derogatory language or targeted slurs towards a specific group. The user discusses their attraction to queer coded characters in Hollywood without using offensive terms.

The text references the user's interest and appreciation for these portrayals in both male and female forms, but this does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or hate speech. 

Overall, while the tweet expresses an unconventional viewpoint of finding villains attractive when queer-coded, it is a personal sentiment rather than hate speech or offense towards any group. The lack of derogatory language supports its neutral classification as simply expressing one's opinion.

In conclusion, this text does not contain the key features that would classify it as hate speech or offensive content, and instead appears to be the user discussing their own attractions in an open but non-harmful manner.

1. The use of the term ""spic"" is a racial slur targeting individuals of Hispanic or Latin descent. This derogatory language immediately puts the content into a category of hate speech.

2. The context of describing a judge using this slur, combined with providing their ethnicity and age, shows an intent to demean based on race. The reference to the bench time and president who appointed them further emphasizes this targeted attack.

3. A group is singled out with the use of a hate term - here, Hispanics are the target of the discrimination. This kind of language contributes to an atmosphere of hate speech.

4. The surrounding context of political leaders winning against Trump also shows that the discriminatory language was used for political points in addition to targeting a race. This makes it even more hateful.

Key Features:
- ""Muzzies"" is a derogatory term used to refer to Muslims.
- ""Peacefully kill her"" directly advocates for violence against an individual Muslim, contradicting the meaning of ""peaceful"".
- The use of first-person pronouns like ""I am sure"" suggests the speaker's own hateful beliefs.

Target Group: 
The tweet targets and threatens a prominent female Muslim advocate with violent language.

Tone & Intent:
The tone is malicious, aiming to incite harm. Referring to Muslims as ""muzzies"" while wishing death upon one of their leaders, even in an ironic sense of ""peaceful killing"", perpetuates harmful stereotypes and violence against the religious group.

Conclusion:
Based on the derogatory slur targeting a specific religion, violent language directed at a Muslim woman, and malicious intent behind it all, this tweet is rightfully classified as hate speech. The key features align with the label's implication while posing harm to Muslims through its discriminatory nature and incite of violence.",14.53

3. The target is clearly Muslims, who are disparaged and associated with acts of terrorism. The text singles out this group for vilification.

4. The tone is one of outright hatred and intolerance. There is no context that could justify such a bigoted remark. It is an attack on the character and integrity of an entire religion and race.

This tweet is classified as hate speech due to its derogatory language and discriminatory targeting of religious and ethnic groups. The usage of the slur ""goy"" to reference non-Jewish people, as well as the explicit racial slurs ""nigger"" and ""muzzie"", categorize this as hate speech.

The key features, including slurs for multiple groups and a threat against their communities, support this classification. The tweet targets individuals of African and Arab descent in an offensive manner.

While the tone is critical and condemning, the context implies that allowing Jewish people into a country would lead to the influx of other groups. This perpetuates harmful stereotypes about the impact of certain ethnic and religious minorities.

The label ""hate speech"" implicates a text that is malicious, discriminatory, or violent toward an individual or group. This classification is justified by the usage of the derogatory slur ""kike,"" which is a well-known anti-Semitic term used to disparage Jewish people. 

The key features point to the bigoted nature of this tweet through targeted hate speech at the Jewish community. The use of this ethnic epithet in an otherwise trivializing context minimizes its offense and perpetuates harmful stereotypes against an entire religious group.

- ""latinos"" references a specific ethnic group in a negative manner.
- Using phrases like ""porch monkey"" and ""u deportation"" threatens harm to these racial minorities.
- Divisive, hurtful words like this are characteristic of hate speech targeting Latinos and African Americans.

Target Group: 
The text specifically targets both African American (""a porch monkey"") and Latino groups with disparaging terms. The use of a slur against one group is amplified by the additional derogatory language used to threaten deportation, further isolating Latinos.

2) The demand for someone to clean their toilet, implying subjugation of the person targeted by race.

The text's impact on or reference to Africans is severe as it utilizes a well-known derogatory term for the race while also alluding to slavery and servitude.

The tone is hostile and demeaning with intent to offend. The user likely knows the harm caused and uses the slur purposefully in an attempt to offend.

In conclusion, this text contains clear hate speech due to its usage of targeted racial slurs in a demeaning manner with apparent ill-intent. Its features and impact on African people classify it as hate speech over other labels.",13.54

This text is classified as normal due to the lack of offensive language or targeted hate speech despite referencing derogatory terms and making a negative comment about someone's appearance. The context appears to be an exchange between two individuals, with one criticizing the other for an insensitive remark made about their partner in their profile.

The key features are the use of the slur ""porch monkey"" (a racist term) and the statement that ""no one loves you ugly bitch"". However, these are not directed at a group but rather as a personal insult between individuals. The tone seems to be that of an argument rather than hate speech or generalized offense.

The target appears to be African people given the use of a slur historically used against them. However, it is not a targeted attack but a specific comment between two individuals with no wider implications.

In conclusion, while offensive terms are used, their context in this exchange does not classify as hate speech. The intent and impact seem limited to an individual rather than a group, justifying the normal label despite the language's offensiveness.",14.05

1. Classification implication: The label of hate speech signifies language that directly attacks a person or group based on their race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation or other identifiable characteristics.

2. Key features: The presence of ""porch monkey"" in the tweet is a key feature supporting its classification as hate speech. ""Porch monkey"" is a well-known racial slur historically used to dehumanize and degrade people of African descent.

3. Target group: The use of this specific slur targets individuals of African descent, making it a direct attack on that ethnic group. 

4. Context and intent: The phrase's usage in the context of telling someone to ""leave me alone"" with the addition of ""lol"", which often softens offensive language, does not change the fact that this is a clear example of hate speech directed at a specific racial group.

5. Conclusion: The use of a well-known slur combined with the targeted nature and lack of any redeeming context classify this as hate speech according to the provided criteria. This type of language has been repeatedly condemned for its harm and perpetuation of racist stereotypes against African people.",15.63

Key points that support this classification include:
- The term ""barbarian"" targets Muslims in a disparaging manner, implying a lack of civilization.
- Referring to them as ""invading"" suggests an unwanted presence and threat. 
- This dehumanizing language perpetuates harmful stereotypes against the targeted religious group.

The reference to evacuating Paris due to flooding takes on a malicious tone given the subsequent attack on Muslims. It implies a false, malicious connection between their faith and harm to France.

The text targets Muslims and refugees as the ""savage invader"" group to be feared and despised. These are all hallmarks of hate speech - using slur terms for an entire religion/culture, depicting them as violent threats, and promoting imagery that dehumanizes them.

Even without specific slurs or vulgarity, this tweet promotes a hateful tone and intent. The use of the kneeling image to portray submission is also problematic. Overall, it's clear this text aims to provoke hate towards Muslims/refugees.

Summary: This text contains discriminatory language targeting the LGBTQ+ community, specifically lesbians.
Key Features:
- The use of a slur for lesbians (""dykes"") 
- Suggesting they are being forced on people
- Implying this is done to appease ""the west""
Target: Lesbians and others in the LGBT+ community
Context: Inflammatory language against a minority group, with a conspiratorial tone.
Conclusion: The use of derogatory terms targeting lesbians, combined with insinuations of malicious intent, classifies this as hate speech. The slur alone would warrant an offensive classification, but the context further supports this assessment.

Classification: Hate Speech
Summary: This text targets and disparages Muslims.
Key Features:
- Using the term ""moslem"" instead of Muslim 
- Implying a negligence incident was caused by a Muslim doctor
Target: Muslims 
Context: Associating a minority group with malpractice, using a derogatory term.
Conclusion: The use of a slur for Muslims in describing a negative event, combined with the implication of guilt based on religious affiliation, categorizes this as hate speech. Such discriminatory language against an ethnic and religious minority has serious consequences.

Classification: Offensive 
Summary: The usage of a slur targeting Mexicans.
Key Features:
- Use of the term ""beaner""
- Expressing preference for Facebook without such content
Target: Mexicans or individuals with Mexican descent 
Context: Trivializing the harm caused by using such language, perpetuating stereotypes.
Conclusion: While hate speech would be warranted due to the use of a slur targeting Mexicans, the casual tone and general request for a ""beaner""-free Facebook space it in the offensive category. The derogatory term still has harmful implications but is not as maliciously intented as hate speech.

Classification: Neutral
Summary: A question about favorite food.
Key Features:
- General phrasing 
- No controversial content
Target: None
Context: A friendly, innocuous inquiry with no harm or offense.
Conclusion: The text's neutral nature and absence of discriminatory language means it poses no harm to any group. Its tone is inquiring but casual and does not perpetuate stereotypes. As a result, it can be classified as simply a neutral question without any offensive implications.

Classification: Hate Speech
Summary: This text targets lesbians with derogatory language while implying malicious intent.
Key Features:
- Use of the slur ""dykes""
- Implying forced acceptance to appease ""the west""
Target: Lesbians and LGBT+
Context: Discriminatory language against a minority group, with conspiratorial undertones.

The post targets Indigenous people and African Americans as the primary subjects of these insults, making the hate speech label appropriate based on this analysis. While the mention of ""yankee"" implies criticism towards white people as well, it serves to distract from their own actions rather than perpetuate harm against them. The text's purpose is clearly to offend and discriminate against the specified groups.
In conclusion, the use of derogatory slurs combined with a dismissive tone that disparages an entire group based on race justifies this post being classified as hate speech. The intent is clear in perpetuating ethnic stereotypes and targeting those groups for ridicule and discrimination.",13.79

The tone is clearly malicious and derogatory towards African Americans. By using slurs in addition to asserting ownership over another race, this constitutes hate speech targeting a specific racial minority.

The context and tone of using a muzzle-loader for sport shooting comes across as informative rather than offensive or hateful in any way. The mention of rain only serves to explain limitations in use.

These words are highly offensive and harmful to the African, Jewish, Hispanic, and Asian communities they disparage.

The tweet also expresses a sense of impending doom for a ""minority"" while referencing constitutional rights. This suggests the author believes that with an increasing non-white population, their perceived ""rights"" will be lost or taken away. The use of explicit slurs to describe these groups in such a context categorizes this as hate speech.

The use of ""sand nigger"" as well targets another minority group associated with people from North Africa and the Middle East. These slurs, coupled with the vulgar sexual comparison, classify this as hate speech intended to offend and demean based on race and religion.

This targets women with demeaning language and a negative stereotype that they spend money on trivial things while complaining about being broke. It perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes.

- No mention of violence/incident
- A seemingly trivial comment about a team

The target audience appears to be the Chicago Bears football team but there's no clear offense towards any other group. This is an important factor as hate speech targets a specific group.

Considering this context and tone, the user seems to be expressing a preference for their team rather than malicious intent targeting another group. Therefore, despite being able to offend some if used inappropriately, ""niggas"" alone does not qualify as offensive language here given the context. The normal label is justified based on this analysis.

- The absence of explicit epithets or slurs directed at a specific race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.
- No description of violence or harm towards the target group referenced. 
The text appears to be expressing political disagreement rather than promoting discrimination or hate. While it may offend some with its accusations, there is no clear intent to dehumanize or incite hatred.

The text also implies that the person posting is a ""filthy kike"" for their actions on this platform, further perpetuating harmful stereotypes against Jewish individuals. The usage of ""you are"" makes it clear that the language is directed at the person themselves, likely because they posted something controversial or revealing their identity as Jewish.

The intent behind the message appears to be one of hate and persecution rather than neutral discussion. It aims to demean and dehumanize a person based on their religious affiliation and ethnicity.

The text uses the term ""blacks"" which is an informal and often derogatory way to refer to people of African descent. The implication that Blacks are falsely accusing White people is a harmful stereotype.

There is also a reference to ""White privilege"", which in this context suggests that the speaker believes they have unfair advantages due to their race.

Key Features:
- Reference to Muslim unity amongst Islamic nations

- Key features include derogatory terms like ""paki"" targeting Pakistani individuals, gendered insults like ""disgust"", and blanket statements of distrust towards women politicians.
- The text directly targets Pakistanis with the use of the slur ""paki"". This is a clear example of hate speech as it attacks an ethnic group. 
- By describing women in high places as needing to be arrested while using gendered slurs like ""disgust"", it perpetuates sexism and stereotypes against female politicians.

The text describes a statement made by Trump about transgender individuals. Key points in this post include:
- The statement being called ""dumb"" by the author 
- Mentions of the F35 program and its continuation during Trump's presidency  
- Accusation that Trump dodged the draft while claiming more courage from queer/trans people than him

The text does not contain any hate speech or targeted offensive language towards any group. The author criticizes Trump's statement, but their own words do not perpetuate harm or discrimination.

The tweet text explicitly targets and discriminates against two groups - Moslems (Muslims) and women wearing the burqa. The use of ""ban"" in both instances implies a complete prohibition or exclusion, which violates basic human rights.

Key features like ""moslem"", ""burqa"", and the double usage of ""ban"" directly point to religious and gender discrimination. These are not general remarks but specific derogatory terms aimed at these groups.

*Key features and their support of the classification:* 
The use of the term ""nigger"" targets African people in a derogatory manner. However, its presence alone does not justify a hate speech classification, as context plays a role. The preceding phrase ""pull up blunt smoking to the weed prada"" is an innocuous comment about marijuana.

*Impact on or reference to target group:*
The text makes no explicit attack, threat, or disparagement of African people. It simply references them in using their slur. This lack of malicious intent keeps it from being hate speech.

*Tone and user intent:* 
Without a clear malicious intention behind the term's usage, this cannot be definitively labeled as hate speech. The tone is more playful and casual than aggressive or vitriolic.

*Conclusion:*
Despite containing a racial slur, the text does not rise to the level of hate speech due to its lack of malicious intent, benign context, and absence of any actual attack or threat made on the targeted group.

Key features that support this classification:
- The term ""kike"" is a well-known anti-Semitic slur used to demean individuals of Jewish descent. Its inclusion in the tweet explicitly targets Jews.
- Implying that a certain ""hasbara"" (presumably meaning Hasbara, a pro-Israel advocacy group) makes someone ""retarded"", using the slur ""retarded"" itself perpetuates ableist language and stereotypes. This is not only offensive but also discriminatory.
- The claim of ""<number> years of inbreeding"" making them ""basically retarded"" is an overtly bigoted attack on Jewish people, with clear hate speech intent.

The target of this tweet is clearly the Jewish community, particularly those involved in pro-Israel advocacy. The usage of anti-Semitic slurs and discriminatory language to demean a group based on their religion or ethnicity marks it as hate speech.

The tweet uses the term ""redneck"" which is a disparaging slur targeted towards white, working-class Southerners. ""Rednecks"" are stereotyped as uneducated, racist, and reactionary. The inclusion of ""sycophants"" also suggests blind loyalty or subservience.

Furthermore, ""carpetbagging"" is another loaded term implying disloyalty to one's region, especially the South after the Civil War when outside politicians were seen as meddlers and profiteers. This adds a historical connotation of offense and betrayal. 

The label 'yankee' at the end, likely referencing Donald Trump being from New York, is another regional slur with negative implications.

Overall, the cumulative effect of these terms, combined with their derogatory nature and divisive regional stereotypes, leads me to categorize this tweet as offensive language targeting specific groups on the basis of race, class, or region. The intent seems to be to offend with a loaded political rant.

I would add that while not strictly hate speech, the inflammatory language, slurs, and general tone of contempt do cross into the realm of clear offense. This justifies its classification as an offensive piece in my view.",23.05

In conclusion, based on the absence of derogatory terms, ethnic/racial stereotypes, or discriminatory language, this text cannot be classified as either hate speech or offensive.

Target group:
The tweet explicitly references Jewish people with hateful language. The use of this slur aims to dehumanize and offend them. 

Tone and intent: 
The user employs this term with clear malice towards Jews. There is no attempt at neutrality or respect; rather a deliberate intent to offend through hate speech directed at an ethnic minority.

- A neutral tone expressing disapproval over a harmful comparison
- No mention of violence, harm, or negativity towards any group

The text targets an argument comparing sexual orientation to racism, but the criticism is aimed at the analogy rather than the groups themselves. The user's intent appears to be one of disagreement with this specific belief rather than hate towards an identity.

In summary, while the language used is provocative and has potential for harm, its usage in this context of critique rather than direct attack leads me to classify it as normal speech that is open to interpretation based on one's beliefs on sexuality.

Summary:
The text appears to be a discussion about a particular behavior or issue being more prevalent in certain groups, specifically Caucasians. The speaker asserts this and adds that middle-aged White individuals are known to mistreat Black servers.

This message is categorized as normal because while it makes generalizations about racial groups based on a negative trait, its tone and intent seem more observational than malicious or derogatory. There's no apparent hatred or clear offense directed at the mentioned races; rather an assertion of what seems to be a perceived trend.

The key features pointing to neutrality are the lack of profanity/epithets, the absence of incendiary language, and the overall descriptive rather than accusatory nature of the post. The impact and tone appear more informative than inflammatory or insulting.

- The tweet uses a racial slur in an ostensibly friendly manner. The use of ""hebanna"" instead of the full epithet is still derogatory and perpetuates ethnic stereotypes.

In conclusion, this text is classified as hate speech due to its use of a derogatory term targeting white people, regardless of intent or casual tone.

1. The text contains a racial slur in ""nigger"" which is an extremely derogatory term used to disparage individuals of African descent.
2. The use of this slur in the context of downplaying someone's accomplishments and referring to them as ""below average"" shows clear malice towards this group.  
3. Key features such as ""the nigger"" directly target Africans with harmful language, establishing hate speech intent.
4. Aiming the slur at an individual with a focus on their race and not their actions further supports its hate speech classification.
5. The usage of the term in a negative context perpetuates ethnic harm and discrimination against African people.

In conclusion, due to the text's explicit use of racial slurs targeting individuals based on their ethnicity alone, with clear malice and no attempt at justification, this is categorized as hate speech aimed at discriminating against Africans based on their race.",12.54

The key points to justify this classification are:

- The message lacks derogatory terms or targeted slurs.
- There is no profanity or explicit content.
- It references a historical event and people's roles in fighting for freedom without any malicious intent.

The target group appears to be the ancestors of whoever the poster is addressing. However, there is no malice, mockery, or stereotyping aimed at them. 

The tone seems more informative than anything else, simply stating a fact about white people's role in fighting for others' freedom. It does not perpetuate ethnic stereotypes or trivializes harm.

This tweet is classified as hate speech due to its overtly derogatory and discriminatory language targeting African Americans. The use of the N-word, a historically racist slur, in conjunction with other bigoted statements against whites perpetuates harmful ethnic stereotypes.

Key features such as the profane content (""fuck""), exclusionary language (""do not give a fuck about blax""), and controlling accusations (""controlling whites"") emphasize its hateful tone and intent to offend. The text's explicit targeting of racial groups, including African Americans, solidifies its hate speech classification based on the criteria.

Contextually, the implication that statements from one group are lies while the other is dishonestly controlling further polarizes the audience. This divisive, discriminatory language has no place in civil discourse and directly violates the principles of equality by targeting a protected class.

In conclusion, this tweet's purposeful use of historically offensive terms to degrade and generalize an ethnic group categorizes it as hate speech. Its profane content and exclusionary tone further justify its classification. The text should be censored based on its intent and impact towards African Americans.",19.86

The key points supporting this classification are:

1. The text expresses confusion and sympathy for the plight of Muslim refugees rather than disparaging them. Words like ""feels pity"" convey a sense of empathy.

2. It compares the treatment of Muslims to other religious groups (Hindu, Sikh, Buddh, Jain) without expressing prejudice towards any one group in particular. This even-handed mention does not single out or demean Muslims. 

3. The tweet seems more like a criticism of governmental policies and ideology than an expression of bigotry. Terms like ""ab to dharm jaat paat bhar nikal jao"" appear to be lamenting rather than ridiculing the idea.

4. There is no derogatory language, inflammatory rhetoric, or inciting violence against any religious group. The tone overall appears more thoughtful and inquisitive than malicious.

In conclusion, based on the text's sympathetic nature towards Muslim refugees while questioning governmental policies, I classify this as normal speech rather than hate speech or an offensive remark.",14.36

The tweet text ""<user> every single white person found dead in a ditch"" is classified as normal due to its lack of harm or offense. 

Key features that support this classification include:
- The absence of derogatory language, slurs, or targeted hate speech 
- No description of violence or harm towards any group
- The vague reference to ""every single white person"" does not perpetuate ethnic stereotypes or incite hatred

The target group of ""white people"" is referenced in a neutral manner without offensive intent. This text doesn't contain the typical markers of hate speech, such as discriminatory terms or calls for violence.

Contextually, this tweet appears to be an incomplete thought rather than a malicious attack on any race. The tone can be interpreted as random musings rather than actively promoting harm.

The text is classified as hate speech due to its discriminatory language and implication that a lack of white individuals in the given images is noteworthy or amusing. 

Key features include the user's assertion that they expected more white people and their expression of amusement at the absence of white faces. This implies an expectation of greater representation from one race and a sense of humor derived from racial homogenization.

The target group appears to be people who are not white, as evidenced by the comment about the absence of white individuals in the images. The tone is casual and lighthearted, but still perpetuates problematic stereotypes and expectations surrounding race.

Given the user's intent to find humor in a perceived lack of racial diversity, and their implication that this is remarkable enough to warrant a comment, I believe the text qualifies as hate speech despite its relatively casual tone. The language employed contributes to an atmosphere of ethnic stereotyping and dismissal of non-white groups through its commentary on racial makeup.

In conclusion, while the severity may be less egregious than other examples of hate speech, this tweet still utilizes racially discriminatory language in a harmful manner that justifies its classification as hate speech over the alternatives.",14.87

The tone of the tweet is casual and humorous rather than malicious or spiteful. It compares living amidst such attitudes unfavorably to residing in a rural area like Arkansas, but this comparison is not meant to offend Arkansans.

1. The label's implication: The classification of this text as normal signifies that it lacks explicit language or targeted hate speech, making it suitable for unrestricted consumption.

2. Key features: There are no specific key features that support a classification of hate speech or offensive content in this text.

3. Target group: While the tweet targets a woman and references her sexual orientation, there is no derogatory or discriminatory intent behind the challenge to engage in a boxing match. The comparison to fighting ""her grandmother"" due to age difference is not aimed at demeaning any group, but rather making a point of the perceived advantage.

4. Context and tone: The context of issuing a challenge for a boxing match rather than hate speech, along with the specification of using heavier gloves while allowing her opponent to use headgear, signifies a more lighthearted intent behind the post. This supports the normal classification.

The text ""an honest moslem"" is classified as normal for several reasons:

1. It lacks discriminatory language or targeted slurs against the referenced religious group (Muslims). 

2. There are no key features that support an offensive or hate speech classification.

3. The absence of derogatory terms and the general nature of the phrase imply a neutral tone rather than a malicious intent to offend or perpetuate stereotypes about Muslims.

4. In context, the phrase does not reference a sensitive incident or stereotype about the target religious group. It simply describes a Muslim person as honest without any harm or negativity.

5. Considering all these factors, this text is normal and lacks controversial elements that would classify it as hate speech or offensive. The neutral language and general tone justify its classification as a normal, unremarkable statement.

In summary, the text ""an honest moslem"" has no discriminatory slurs, stereotypes, or sensitive context to categorize it as hate speech or offensive.

The tweet's key features include the slur ""kike,"" a term used to offend Jews, as well as ""nigger"" which disparages black people.

These epithets are not only inherently offensive but also perpetuate harmful stereotypes against these groups. By referencing articles on rising antisemitism while using a slur for Jews and another for blacks, it implies a link between Trump supporters and anti-Semitic incidents.

The impact on the target groups cannot be overstated. These terms have a long history of being used to demean and dehumanize people of color and Jewish individuals. The usage in this context, implying guilt of Trump supporters while only mentioning suspects from these groups, furthers damaging stereotypes.

Furthermore, no context is provided to justify the usage of such language. Rather than condemn hate, the tone appears to trivialized it by making an unsubstantiated claim about articles on Trump supporters and their supposed connection to anti-Semitic incidents.

Therefore, this text's blatant use of racial slurs targeting specific groups while spreading misinformation earns its classification as hate speech. The key features are central in supporting this label due to how they offend the target groups in a context with malicious intent.

The concise analysis is that the tweet contains hate speech due to its derogatory language aimed at two ethnic and religious groups, with no justification for its usage or condemnation of such words, furthering harmful stereotypes. The context and key features like ""kike"" and ""nigger"" all support this classification as the text targets these groups in an offensive manner without proper context or intent to condemn hate.",19.98

The targeted group is clearly women, based on the usage of this gendered insult. The tone appears dismissive and disparaging towards the referenced females.

Intent & context:
In referring to a woman as a ""hoe"" in an apparently lighthearted way (""they just some hating""), the tweet minimizes harm but still normalizes sexism. By downplaying the derogatory term, it ignores its impact on women.

The language targets women, especially those of color, perpetuating harmful stereotypes. The crude nature of these terms further amplifies their offensiveness.

The user appears to be referencing the fact that a group of individuals being discussed are all white. However, there is no derogatory intent or targeted language used here.

Key points supporting this classification:
- The emojis used represent laughter and positive expressions, indicating a lighthearted tone.
- There is no mention of discriminatory terms or stereotypes aimed at any race.
- The user expresses affection (""love that for me""), without promoting harm towards the group.

Considering the context and tone, the text does not perpetuate hate speech or contain explicit offenses. Rather, it seems to be a lighthearted acknowledgement of an aspect of the referenced group's demographics. As such, based on the analysis, this text is categorized as normal due to its lack of controversial language or targeted remarks aimed at any race or religion.

The tweeter references an incident where <user> demanded the deplatforming of some Muslim fundies, but later defended white nationalists on national TV, accusing them of hypocrisy. However, this reference alone without explicit slurs or targeted insults does not qualify as hate speech or offensive content.

The tweet's tone is critical and accusatory towards the target group (<user>) for their perceived double standard and alleged hypocrisy regarding free speech, particularly when it relates to white nationalists. The implication is that <user>'s actions were inconsistent and discriminatory in some way.

However, even this criticism does not cross the threshold into hate speech or offensive territory without accompanying derogatory terms aimed at a particular race, religion, gender, etc. At its core, the content remains an opinionated statement rather than harmful hate speech or targeted verbal abuse.

Explanation:
The text is labeled as a normal tweet rather than hate speech or offensive content. This classification makes sense given that there are no derogatory terms, slurs, or targeted language aimed at any group.

The text appears to be a neutral statement about not using the term ""illegal alien"" when referring to non-citizen individuals. There is no overtly hateful or offensive nature to this request, but rather an innocuous suggestion for more polite terminology.

Without any discriminatory words or inflammatory rhetoric directed towards a specific race, religion, sexuality, etc., the tone of the text remains normal and inoffensive. The user's intent seems to be promoting more considerate language when describing individuals who are not U.S. citizens.

In conclusion, this analysis supports the classification as a neutral tweet due to its benign content, lack of targeted slurs or hate speech, and an overall innocuous tone.",11.81

1. Label implication: The label of ""normal"" suggests that the text does not contain hate speech or offensive language targeted at a specific group.

3. Target: The target is undefined (NaN), indicating that no specific racial, religious, disabled, etc. group is being referenced negatively.

4. Context and tone: While a negative sentiment of hatred is expressed towards another user, it does not reference any protected characteristics to qualify as hate speech. The tone is confrontational but lacks the critical features to be considered hate or offensive speech directed at a particular demographic.

5. Conclusion: Based on the absence of key discriminatory language, lack of a specific target group being referenced negatively, and a neutral context without explicit hate/abuse, this text can be classified as normal despite the general negative tone and sentiment expressed towards another user.

- The absence of derogatory slurs, epithets, or targeted insults 
- No perpetuation of hate speech or inciting violence against a group

The text does not contain any hate speech or offensive language. It appears to be a political commentary that raises concerns about public health and vaccination policies.

Key features include the mention of disease, lack of choice, and failure to modernize vaccination manufacturing processes. These points are used to argue against what seems to be an aggressive stance towards concerned parents in the context of a disagreement over vaccination policies.

The target appears to be an unspecified group or authority that is ""going to war"" on concerned parents without addressing their concerns first.

Based on the context and tone, it can be inferred that this text is meant as political commentary rather than hate speech. The user seems to be using rhetorical language to express exasperation at what they perceive as aggression against themselves or others who share similar views on vaccination policies.

- There is no explicit mention of violence or harm towards the targeted group. 
- The implication of Muslims having ""enough countries"" to go to has an exclusionary tone, but this is not a direct threat.

The text does not contain any hate speech or offensive language. Instead, it appears to be a general commentary on gender dynamics and the lack of listening from men in conversations with women. Key features such as derogatory slurs or targeted insults are absent. 

The tone is critical but does not single out a specific group, rather making a broader observation about gendered interactions and labour. There is no explicit offense or harm aimed at any one group.

Overall, the text's message, while potentially controversial in some views, remains a general opinion without hate speech or targeted offensive language. Its neutral tone supports this classification.",8.93

The key feature of using the word ""bitch"" in an interrogative manner shows a lack of respect and trivializes harm caused to women by such language.

Although not directly targeted at any specific woman, the usage of this slur perpetuates gender stereotypes and contributes to a culture demeaning to females in general. 

The tone has an exasperated but ultimately casual intent which, while not maliciously hateful, is still disrespectful enough to be considered offensive rather than simply a neutral query about Lisbon's weather.

In conclusion, the text's use of a derogatory term aimed at women combined with its trivializing and demeaning nature warrants it being classified as an offensive statement that may cause harm or offense.",10.47

The text contains the use of a highly derogatory and offensive term in ""nigger"" to target African individuals. This is a well-known ethnic slur with a history of perpetuating racism and oppression. 

The casual mention of ""hunting niggers"" implies violence or harm towards this group, further qualifying it as hate speech. There are no mitigating circumstances; the language and intended actions are clear in their discriminatory nature.

This text targets African people in an extremely harmful manner through the utilization of a slur historically linked to racist abuse. The context around ""tweaking"" also suggests the individuals may be experiencing negative effects from illicit substances, painting them as weak or helpless while being targeted with hateful terms.

There is no ambiguity - this tweet promotes hate speech by using a derogatory ethnic slur and alluding to violence towards Africans. Its intent is clear in its offensive language and harm it causes to the target group. The label of hate speech is justified based on these key features and the text's overall malicious tone and impact.

In conclusion, this tweet exemplifies hate speech through its use of a well-known derogatory term with discriminatory implications for African people. Its casual mention of harm towards this group further classifies it as extremely offensive language that targets an ethnic minority with violence. The classification is appropriate based on the text's clear malicious intent and abusive nature.",16.74

The key features are absent of derogatory language, ethnic slurs, religious discrimination, or other factors that would support hate speech or offensive classifications.

The target audience appears to be an unspecified user, with whom the poster is seeking help regarding a printing issue with their son's homework. There is no indication that any group or individual is being targeted or discriminated against.

The text's context and tone are helpful rather than harmful. The urgency of the request for assistance is evident but does not imply malice or ill intent towards a particular race, religion, orientation, etc. 

In conclusion, this normal classification is justified given the absence of offensive key features, the lack of targeting any specific group, the helpful context and tone, and the lack of harm in its language or message. The text appears to be an innocent request for help rather than an attempt at hate speech or offense towards a particular individual or minority.

The text's intent is clearly to offend by invoking these epithets for different groups. The profuse repetition aimed at African, bisexual, disabled, homosexual, Jewish, Muslim, refugee, and women targets exacerbates the offensiveness. Additionally, it encourages further hate speech in the mention of ""I can play this child game all day long on gab speak freely"", promoting more derogatory content.

The tone is entirely mocking and disparaging with no attempt at nuance or respect for any group. The text's blatant use of hate speech to target so many groups categorizes it as highly offensive, though not necessarily hate speech due to the lack of overt threats/calls to violence. Nevertheless, this prolific language perpetuating negative stereotypes and slurs earns it an offensive label given its clear intent to offend.",15.3

1. The label implies that the text contains content which may be found disturbing or inappropriate, causing offense to a group or individual.

2. Key features in this include the phrases ""woman were made to wear skirts"" and ""easier to rape them."" These feature sexist language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes about women's bodies being more vulnerable to sexual violence while wearing certain clothes.

3. The target is clearly women, with the tweet making a dehumanizing statement about their clothing choices being conducive to rape. This generalization targets an entire gender.

4. While not explicitly hate speech, it trivializes sexual violence against women and implies their clothing choices make them complicit in enabling rapes. The casual tone of a ""realization"" also minimizes this violent crime.

5. In conclusion, the offensive label is warranted due to how it casually perpetuates rape culture through a targeted sexist statement about an entire gender. The trivializing nature of its intent and use of violent imagery make it more impactful than simply an innocuous comment.",13.81

The term ""kike"" has been used throughout history to dehumanize and discriminate against Jewish people. Its casual use in this short message downplays its offensiveness while still perpetuating anti-Semitic stereotypes.

The text is classified as hate speech due to its usage of highly offensive and derogatory language, specifically the n-word and anti-Semitic slurs. These terms are used in a disparaging manner towards their respective ethnic groups.

Key features like ""jew"", ""nigger"", and ""twat"" immediately flag this post for hate speech. The author references both African and Jewish people with such offensive epithets. This targeted language perpetuates harmful stereotypes while trivializing the impact of discriminatory slurs.

The text also expresses a sense of alienation in California, which may be a veiled reference to diversity. Mentioning ""this jew nigger twat culture"" paints a crude picture of the author's perspective on multicultural society.

The term ""queers"" could be seen as derogatory towards the LGBTQ+ community, but based on context, it appears to be used in a more playful or satirical manner when describing people with excessive money who are drawn to tacticool and milspec gear.

The main point is that the language and content does not intend to cause harm or offense to any group.

The text is classified as normal due to its lack of explicit offensive language or targeted discrimination towards any group. While the tweet may be seen as insensitive in prioritizing domestic poverty over refugee aid, it does not contain hate speech or direct offensiveness.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- The general discussion of resource allocation rather than use of derogatory terms.
- Lack of references to specific ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations etc. 
- Focus on the socioeconomic impact on citizens rather than perpetuating stereotypes or prejudice.

The target of ""NaN"" signifies the lack of a specific group being referenced with ill intent. The context and tone do not imply malice but rather economic pragmatism.

Summary:
This text categorizes as hate speech due to its derogatory language and discriminatory tone towards the Jewish and Muslim communities. Key features include the pejorative term 'moslem', referring to Muslims in a derrogatory manner, and generalizing that ""American jew[s]"" have malicious intent when commenting on terrorist attacks or immigration.

The text specifically targets these religious groups through stereotyping and conspiracy theories (""moslem invasion of europe""). The smirk referenced implies deceit or ulterior motives from Jews. 

The overall tone is one of animosity towards these minorities, perpetuating harmful stereotypes in a context of terrorism. This promotes discrimination and hostility, categorizing it as hate speech aimed at these religious groups.

The use of the slur ""kike"" to refer to Jewish people and implying their extermination targets them with prejudice.

The text's tone is threatening rather than a neutral hypothetical scenario. It expresses malice towards a group based on perceived beliefs or identity. While not explicitly inciting violence, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and encourages discriminatory action from medical professionals against Jews.

Key features that support this classification include:
- The use of the term ""mosques"" to reference mosques, combined with describing them as ""preaching hate"", perpetuates harmful stereotypes against Muslims. 
- Derogatory terms like ""pigs"" and ""bastards"" directed at Muslims are clear examples of discriminatory language.
- Blame is placed solely on ""moslems"" for attacks while exonerating the perpetrator, further stigmatizing this group.

The text targets both Muslims (""mosques"", ""moslems"") as well as individuals of South Asian descent (the slur ""paki""). Its tone is clearly derogatory and discriminatory in nature, placing blame squarely on these groups. This type of hate speech is not tolerated on most platforms due to the harm it causes to the target audience.

In conclusion, this tweet's use of explicit slurs against Muslims and individuals of South Asian descent, combined with its accusatory tone directed at ""moslems"", categorizes it as hate speech aimed at stigmatizing these groups.

Explanation:
The text describes a hypothetical scenario of experiencing severe physical pain while dying. It does not contain hate speech or offensive language targeting any group. While the imagery is disturbing and evokes suffering, it does not single out any particular race, religion, gender, sexual orientation etc. to attack or demean them.

The key features do not reveal any explicit slurs, discriminatory terms, or inflammatory content. The text presents a vivid but fictional account of pain that could befall anyone, without focusing on a specific type of person as the target. 

Considering this, the neutral classification is appropriate given the lack of hate speech, offensive language, or harm towards a particular group in the description provided.

Therefore, while the imagery may be disturbing to read, it does not qualify as hate speech or an offensive comment directed at someone based on their characteristics. A neutral classification is warranted for this post without malicious intent to offend any protected class.",12.24

Key features include the derogatory term ""nigger"" used in reference to Ben's race. This word is a well-known slur that has historically been used to dehumanize and disparage black individuals.

The target group appears to be Africans, as evidenced by the use of an epithet commonly associated with this racial minority. The fact that it was included at all, rather than using Ben's name or another identifier for him, demonstrates a clear intention to degrade based on race.

While the initial statement ""Ben is cool"" implies he is well-liked, the latter part of the sentence undermines any positive sentiment by resorting to a slur in describing him. This reveals an underlying prejudice and willingness to offend for no reason beyond his race.

In conclusion, the text exemplifies hate speech due to its use of racist language targeted at an ethnic group, demonstrating hostility and contempt based on race alone with no justification or context that would allow it to be viewed as a neutral statement.

The reference to a ""paki"" mayor in an allegedly humorous setup makes light of ethnic stereotypes and targets a specific racial group.

Key features:
- The term ""paki"" is a well-known slur used to demean individuals of Pakistani heritage.
- Its usage in the context of a purported joke trivializes the harm such language causes when directed at an ethnic minority.
- By pairing this with stereotypical Jewish and Caucasian roles, it perpetuates racist stereotypes.

Target:
- This post specifically targets people of South Asian descent, invoking their identity as the punchline for a joke. It also uses offensive terms to refer to individuals of other races.

Context/Tone:
- The attempt at humor is used to mask the offensiveness of the slur and stereotyping.
- By framing it as ""the start of a joke"", it tries to downplay the harm caused by its derogatory language. 
- However, this does not diminish the impact on Pakistani individuals or excuse the offensive nature.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the post is classified as offensive due to its derogatory slur targeting people of Pakistani descent in an allegedly humorous context. The term ""paki"" has clear ethnic slurs connotations that cannot be dismissed as a joke. This offends not only the targeted group but also perpetuates racist stereotypes more broadly.

The key features support this classification by showcasing how the post specifically uses a known slur while stereotyping multiple races. Its target is the Pakistani community and others, while its tone tries to diminish the offensiveness of the language used. In light of this analysis, the offensive label fits as it is intended to demean an ethnic minority with no regard for their rights or dignity.

- No redeeming or positive content is present to counterbalance the hateful epithet and implication.

In conclusion, this text uses a well-known anti-Semitic slur while expressing callous indifference towards the targeted group's wellbeing.

There is no clear target in this tweet other than referencing the Dutch mayor's comments. The context appears to be the user sharing an interesting statement they heard from a public figure rather than any intent to cause harm or offend.

- No clear intention to offend or disparage based on race
- A hypothetical situation rather than directly targeting a group

The text's target appears to be the African and Caucasian races, but it does not single either out with discriminatory language. Rather, it poses an uncomfortable thought experiment that could apply to people of any race.

The context and tone don't contain hate speech indicators like slurs or stereotyping. The user seems more intent on pondering a provocative ""what if"" scenario rather than actively denigrating a group.

In conclusion, while the tweet may be seen as offensive for its mention of racial epithets and hypothetical discriminatory behavior, it does not categorize as hate speech itself given its lack of targeted slurs or bigoted language. Its neutral tone and intent to provoke thought rather than offend makes this classification appropriate based on the analysis provided above. Let me know if you would like me to explain further or provide a more detailed breakdown. I'm happy to expand on this reasoning to help better understand the text's classification!",16.71

Key features such as the use of profanity and self-description as a ""thief"" could be seen as potentially offensive, but in this context they are directed towards an individual rather than a larger demographic category.

The user's assertion that their behavior is not their fault suggests a personal struggle or vulnerability. This along with the aggressive yet oddly introspective tone implies the post may be an expression of frustration or self-criticism rather than hate speech.

In summary, while the language is vulgar, it does not appear to be perpetuating ethnic/religious slurs or stereotypes targeted at any group, nor trivializing harm towards a minority. The intent seems more self-directed than offensive. Therefore, based on its lack of hate speech or targeted offense, this post is classified as normal.",11.47

In summary, while the term ""ghetto"" can be controversial depending on context, its use here appears to be more descriptive of the author's outlook and language choice rather than perpetuating stereotypes or hate speech towards any racial group.

This text is classified as neutral due to its non-controversial nature and absence of targeted language. The tweet appears to be a factual statement or reference to various media outlets without any derogatory slurs, offensive content or hate speech directed at specific groups.

The key features in this text are names referencing media institutions like the Logan Roy School for Journalism, HBO's Jack the Ripper series, and a women's health clinic. These references lack harm or offense to any particular race, religion, gender, etc. 

This neutral classification is supported by the general tone that does not perpetuate stereotypes or discriminate against protected classes. The text simply lists these media outlets without commentary, making it innocuous.

In conclusion, this tweet lacks controversial elements and targeted slurs that would classify it as hate speech or offensive. Its benign nature referencing specific institutions justifies its classification as a normal, neutral statement free of harmful intent or derogation towards any group.",15.67

- While the tweet contains an apparent slur and targets someone based on race, I would classify this as normal because it lacks malicious intent or hate speech elements.
- The usage of ""nigga"" here seems like casual slang used between friends. Combined with the joking tone and lack of discriminatory context, this is more of a lighthearted remark than an act of hate speech towards African people or men.

1. Label implication: The classification of ""normal"" implies that the tweet is benign and not offensive or hateful in nature.

2. Key features: No key features are listed, suggesting a lack of controversial content or targeted language.

3. Target group: With no target mentioned (NaN), the text does not single out any specific group for derogatory comments or hate speech.

4. Context and intent: The tone appears frustrated rather than malicious, with the speaker expressing reluctance to deal with an individual's attitude after work. This suggests a more personal grievance than general vitriol.

5. Conclusion: With no clear derogation, targeted slurs, or hateful language, this tweet is justified as neutral based on the absence of features that would classify it otherwise. The classification may be due to the context being perceived as non-ethnic rather than racial epithets.

In summary, while some words are used, they lack clear ethnic/racial intent and instead convey a workplace grievance without hate or offense.

The target appears to be people of Caucasian descent, but the text does not contain overtly hateful or offensive content towards this group. Rather, it seems to be more of a personal defense than an attack.

In conclusion, while the text may have some contentious elements and references to race/ethnicity, its overall tone and intent is defensive rather than offensive. The context suggests the user's father was being accused of something (likely due to his race), but the speaker is defending him as an elderly sick man who worked hard for his family.

Its usage here perpetuates this negative stereotype in a demeaning manner.

The emojis <emoji><emoji><emoji> emphasize the casual and flippant nature of the racism being referenced. This tone downplays the harm caused by such language, which is highly offensive to those targeted by it.

Ultimately, the use of this racial slur aimed at a specific ethnic group, combined with the minimization of its offensiveness, categorizes this as an offensive tweet that contributes to discriminatory stereotypes and slurs. Its intent appears to be humorous or satirical but still causes harm to the referenced group.

In conclusion, based on the presence of targeted derogatory language in an insensitive context, I believe the text should be classified as offensive hate speech rather than simply offensive. The term ""redneck"" is a slur with an intent of demeaning and disparaging a specific ethnic group. It's usage here perpetuates those stereotypes and slurs in a demeaning manner. This classification should remain at the higher level of hate speech due to the clear discriminatory content.

The text is classified as hate speech due to its use of a racial slur and derogatory term in describing African women. The usage of the n-word, which has historically been used to denigrate Black people, targets this ethnic group with contempt.

The intent seems hostile, as it invokes stereotypes around Black women in positions of service while belittling them with a slur. There is no context to justify this usage or classify it otherwise.

- The target groups referenced are Caucasians and unspecified others, but no abusive or discriminatory terms are used. Mentions of political affiliations do not qualify as hate speech.

The key features point to the usage of racial slur 'nigger' as well as homophobic slur 'faggot'. Both are highly offensive, used to demean groups.

This text targets African Americans and the LGBTQ+ community directly through hate speech slurs. The intent seems malicious given the comparison that ""we"" are better than them in every way.

The tone is mocking with a flippant laugh (""lol"") while the derogatory language makes it clear this is not lighthearted at all but rather an attack.

In conclusion, based on the hate speech slurs targeted at two groups and the malicious intent behind using such offensive terms for comparison, this text can be classified as hate speech without reservation.",11.54

Key points include the derogatory terms ""sharia"" and ""coons,"" which are used in a disparaging manner towards religious and ethnic groups.

- The term ""coons"" is a well-known racial slur used to describe individuals of African descent. Its usage perpetuates harmful stereotypes and derogates the targeted group, affirming this as hate speech.
- ""Sharia"" refers to the body of Islamic law derived from the Quran and Sunnah. The tone implies fear or disapproval at its implementation, further solidifying the discriminatory nature of the message towards religious groups.

- These key features are used to target ethnic and religious minorities in a derogatory manner. The context and intent behind this language is clearly to disparage these groups, which defines it as hate speech.
- Additionally, it's trivialization through the term ""fun"" shows the user has no remorse for its harm, solidifying the text as hate speech.

In conclusion, based on this analysis of key features and targeted content towards religious and ethnic groups with a clear derogatory intent, this tweet is classified as hate speech. Its discriminatory language and disparaging message towards the referenced groups exemplify hate speech.",15.44

The language used is gratuitously profane and sexually explicit with clear intent to offend Moslems. Comparing them to inbred shite crosses the threshold into hate speech. The tone is crude and malicious, perpetuating harmful stereotypes about an ethnic minority. There is no attempt at a balanced or open discussion; only a vulgar put-down of Moslems.

The impact on Moslems would be severely offensive. This kind of sexually perverse hate speech dehumanizes them and crosses the line into inciting harm. The lack of any justification or context further supports the conclusion that this is hate speech aimed squarely at offending Moslems.",12.52

- The label's implication is that this text is normal. However, key features include violent language targeting queer women artists.

The violent language promoting harm towards queer women artists makes this more suitable as hate speech. The term ""d*e"" combined with other derogatory content in an aggressive context targets a minority group with the intent to cause trauma and abuse.

As this text explicitly promotes violence against queer women, its tone is clearly malicious, even if not necessarily directed at a specific person/group. Its abusive nature outweighs any classification as normal.

Therefore, based on the violent language, targeted malice towards a group, and lack of mitigating context, I would classify this as hate speech that promotes harm against queer women artists, with the key features supporting the text's abusive intent.

The classification is not neutral due to its violent slurs and abuse directed at a minority group in an aggressive context.",14.87

The text is classified as offensive due to its derogatory language and targeted tone towards specific groups.

Key features that support this classification include:
- The use of the slur ""bitch"" to describe the roommate, which is a vulgar and demeaning term often used to belittle women.
- The implied generalization of sapiosexuals as undesirable or deserving ridicule. While the author's personal experience with discrimination is relevant, targeting an entire group in this manner is offensive.

The text targets groups including homosexuals (with references to queer and same-sex attraction), women (with gendered slurs), and potentially religious individuals (the roommate being a Mormon). These specific demographics are singled out for criticism or ridicule.

However, the author's intent seems more personal than ideological. The vitriol towards sapiosexuals is largely based on the author's own negative experience with their roommate rather than general hatred of the group. This mutes the offense somewhat.

In conclusion, while the language is certainly offensive and the text targets specific demographics for mockery, it lacks the malicious intent required to classify it as hate speech. The classification should be offensive due to its vulgar tone, derogatory language, and targeted criticism towards gendered groups with whom the author disagrees or holds grudges against.",15.94

- Telling women to let them know when they get ""full blown raped"" is an overt threat.

- The text targets Muslims with graphic content, implying harm based on religion. The use of ""moslem"" perpetuates Islamophobic stereotypes.

- Key Features:
   - Usage of the term ""cocksucker"" as an epithet. 
   - Referring to individuals as ""wastes of sperm"", dehumanizing them.
   - The phrase ""muzzy"" is a slur against Muslims, with the added violent wish for harm on them.
   - The reference to David Hogg, a survivor of a mass shooting, in a derogatory manner.

- Target Analysis: 
   - The text targets and disparages both an economic minority (referring to them as ""wastes"")...
   ...and Muslims (""muzzy""), perpetuating ethnic/religious hate.
   - It also targets David Hogg, an individual with strong political views, using violent imagery.

   - Violently wishing harm on a religious group in the context of a gun control debate. 
   - Referring to individuals as ""wastes"" and using slurs against them.

- Conclusion: This text meets all criteria for hate speech due to its targeted violent language towards an individual, religious group, and economic minority; with malicious intent in a sensitive political context.

This slur, one of the most vile and inflammatory slurs directed towards African Americans, has a long history of being used to dehumanize and degrade black people. Its usage in this context perpetuates racist stereotypes and aims to offend and demean.

The key feature of using this slur to refer to JR Smith is what makes this offensive. It is a targeted insult aimed at an individual due to their race. The fact that it was suggested someone could use this term against him ""tonight"" implies the speaker's intent is malicious.

This tone and language choice has a negative impact on African Americans, even as a hypothetical situation. The usage of such inflammatory language in any context would be considered offensive for how it perpetuates discrimination.

- No clear derogation or harm is being directed at a specific person/group.
- Westbrook and Harden are used in comparison but no vitriolic language targets them.

The general tone appears to be lighthearted banter rather than malicious. The text doesn't single out any group for abuse, making it a normal post rather than hate speech or even offensive. A more nuanced context would be needed for it to be categorized as hate speech/offensive.

The intent appears to be shaming, degrading and rejecting a person on basis of gender or sexual orientation when they've expressed interest. The vulgarity, slurs and aggression classify this as an offensive post aimed at these groups with clear malicious purpose behind the language used.

Key Features:
- The use of the word ""bitch"", which many consider an offensive slur directed at women.
- Implying that women are pregnant based on their social media behavior, rather than having an open conversation.

Target Group: 
Women seem to be the target group, with the implication being made about their pregnancy based on posting dates.

Context and Intent:
The tone of the tweet appears to be accusatory or critical towards a woman's actions. The use of derogatory language in this context implies an intent to shame or belittle women for perceived dishonesty.

Conclusion:
Based on the text's content, targeting language, and derogatory tone, classifying it as ""offensive"" is appropriate. The tweet contributes to perpetuating misogyny through its use of a slur and shaming behavior. A more neutral approach without targeted slurs would have avoided this classification altogether.",13.02

Target is NaN (not a number), implying no clear target audience. 

Intent appears to be advising followers to block the referenced individual based on prior unspoken advice from ""kash doll."" The tone is colloquial and seemingly lighthearted, given the use of emojis like 🤩‍♡ and slang terms.

- This tweet targets African men, using offensive language while wishing harm on the group.
- The tone is aggressive with violent intent towards the target group.
- In conclusion, this text qualifies as hate speech due to its use of discriminatory slurs and violent rhetoric aimed at a specific ethnic and gender group.

So in summary:
1. Hate speech label implies the text targets and abuses a group.
2. ""Niggas"" is a key derogatory term used against African people.
3. Threatening to ""max them tf out"" targets African men with harm.
4. The tone promotes violent action towards this group.

- Emphasis on the illegality and massive nature of this alleged plot.
- Tone and language used, such as referring to impeachment as making them ""mcangry"" enough for some sort of mind trick.

1. The use of the term ""bitch"" to describe a woman is inherently derogatory and misogynistic. It perpetuates sexist stereotypes and targets women as objects of abuse.

2. The phrase ""bad white bitch"" explicitly combines this gendered slur with a racial identifier, implying that white women are being singled out for derision. This adds another layer of bigoted language.

3. By using the term ""bitch,"" the author is invoking an established slur used to demean and degrade females. This abusive language aims to reduce the target's humanity.

4. The request to hit someone with keys, an object that could inflict harm, indicates violent intent. It may be a figure of speech but still normalizes aggressive behavior towards women.

5. By addressing this user directly (""<user>""), it personalizes the abuse and creates a culture of hostility where people are openly harassed with bigoted terms.

These slurs are directed towards African Americans, the disabled community, and the LGBQ+ minority group. The user's intent appears to be discriminatory, using hate speech as a way to offend these groups.

Furthermore, the inclusion of ""dishwasher time"" is concerning due to its association with racial stereotyping and harmful stereotypes about intelligence. This phrase, coupled with the rest of the text, displays a clear disregard for ethnic minorities and those with disabilities.

The tone is one of blatant disrespect and malice towards several minority groups, demonstrating that hate speech was used as a means of targeting these groups and trivializing their identities. As such, this tweet can be reasonably classified as hate speech due to its use of multiple slurs aimed at specific groups in a discriminatory manner.",15.6

1. The text directly targets and derogates individuals with Down syndrome and intellectual disability. Using terms like ""retarded"" and ""faggot"" in this context is extremely offensive, especially when combined with the threat of violence.

This language trivializes and mocks individuals with intellectual impairments while promoting ethnic stereotyping of white women. The context suggests the user is expressing disdain for Margot Robbie's behavior.

This text is classified as normal for the following reasons:

The tweet describes online content creators and their tendency to include derogatory terms in videos. The specific words used are slurs targeting the LGBT+ community (""faggot"") and disabled individuals (""retarded""). However, their usage here seems more ironic or satirical than maliciously targeted at any group.

The context of ""souls fandom"" content suggests the creator is referencing a broader cultural trend rather than directly attacking those referenced. The tone appears to be reflective rather than inciting hate towards the groups mentioned.

The label's implication for the text is that it expresses hatred towards a group(s) of people based on their race, religion, sexual orientation, or other characteristic. The text explicitly endorses harm against Hispanics, Muslims and gay men.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- Using derogatory terms like ""spic"" to target individuals of Hispanic descent.
- Expressing pleasure at the deaths of these groups with phrases like ""<number> dead spic faggots.""
- Referring to their religion (Muslim) in a derogative manner.
- Suggesting they do not belong in the country, an exclusionary and xenophobic sentiment.

The text directly targets multiple protected groups, celebrating violence against them. Its offensive language and discriminatory beliefs make it hate speech targeting Hispanics, Muslims, and gay men.

The tone indicates the person accepts such harmful language being used against them over something as trivial as a joke.

Summary: The tweet expresses frustration with traffic and appears to be addressed to someone named Supreme Boi. It includes an apology for using the f-word but does not contain any hate speech or offensive language targeting a specific group.

Key Features:
- The use of profanity in addressing Supreme Boi, 
- Expressing annoyance at the traffic situation,
- Apologizing for the use of profanity while still blaming Supreme Boi.

Target: 
The target is Supreme Boi. No other groups are targeted or referenced.

Tone & Intent:
The tone comes across as annoyed and frustrated with the traffic situation. The intent seems to be venting about a difficult commuting experience.

Conclusion:
This tweet does not contain hate speech, offensive language, or any targeted remarks towards an identifiable group.

The key feature supporting this classification is the user's casual and derogatory use of a racial slur (""nigger""). This word has a long history as an extremely offensive term used to denigrate people of African descent.

The text targets people of African origin, implying a deep-seated prejudice in its author. Rather than using any alternative that could be less inflammatory, the user chose this specific slur to dehumanize and belittle their target. Their intent is clear - they want to offend.

Context cannot salvage what would otherwise be hate speech. The casual tone only worsens it by suggesting a lack of remorse or concern for the offense taken. To dismiss such language's impact on the targeted group is a further insult.

In conclusion, this tweet is hate speech due to its purposeful use of a historically offensive slur with clear intent to offend based on race.

There is no clear target group being disparaged. The reference to ""white trash"" could be seen as derogatory but in this context it appears to be a literal description of a themed party rather than an attack on white people.

The text ""go back to twitter this is a kike free community"" classifies as hate speech due to the targeted use of an anti-Semitic slur. 

Key features:
- ""kike"" - The derogatory term aimed at Jewish people, implying a sense of superiority over them.
- ""free"" and ""community"" used together, suggesting exclusion or segregation based on religion.

Target group: 
The text targets Jewish individuals as the basis for this discriminatory separation. The use of ""kike"", an anti-Semitic slur, singles out Jews in a derogatory manner.

Intent:
The tone comes across as hostile and exclusive towards Jews. There is no hint of irony or light-heartedness in this targeted message. It appears to be earnestly promoting a Jewish-free community, which aligns with hate speech.

Conclusion:
Given the blatant anti-Semitic slur used to promote exclusion of Jews, alongside the discriminatory intent behind the text's segregation-based community, this categorizes as hate speech due to its direct harm and malice aimed at the Jewish people.",13.9

The text's target audience appears to be Muslim refugees in Germany, with the suggestion that they should be deported. The use of an alternate spelling of ""Muslim"" as a slur implies the intent to offend this group. 

References to ISIS and Syria may attempt to justify the hate speech by associating Muslims with terrorists. However, it only serves to perpetuate dangerous stereotypes.

2. The mention of a violent incident in Texas coupled with the sarcasm directed at it (""fake thoughts and prayers"") references recent gun violence, evoking harm to human life. This impact targets both Arabs/Muslims and the victims of mass shootings.

As a neutral list of movie titles, the tone appears to be informative rather than malicious or targeted. There is no apparent intent to offend or degrade based on race, religion, disability, etc. 

In summary, this text does not contain the characteristics of hate speech or offensive language. It appears to be an innocent list of movie titles without harmful intent or targeting towards any group, making it a normal neutral classification based on the content and context presented.",12.5

The derogatory term, combined with the rest of the post's vulgar language, reveals a hateful intent and perpetuates harmful stereotypes towards the LGBT community.
The key feature ""faggot"" directly targets and offends individuals identifying as homosexual or bisexual. Its inclusion in the tweet, especially when paired with other inappropriate language, demonstrates the user's intent to offend this group through their words.
Though not rising to the level of hate speech due to a lack of overt incitement or threats, this post is nevertheless offensive in nature for its bigoted and homophobic tone that discriminates against a specific minority. As such, it warrants an ""offensive"" classification based on its content and the harm it causes to its target group through using slurs and vulgarity as a means of trivialization.

In summary, the presence of a slur targeting homosexuals (""faggot""), the post's vulgar tone, and intent to offend this minority justify classifying this tweet as offensive. The language used is disparaging and bigoted towards LGBT individuals, perpetuating discrimination through its content. Though not hate speech per se, the post still merits an ""offensive"" label due to these factors.

The text targets individuals of Jewish descent, homosexuals (the term ""dyke""), and women. By combining these slurs with vulgar language like ""fuck"", it is clear that the user intends to offend all three groups.

Additionally, the use of a string of slurs rather than a single slur implies an especially malicious intent - the speaker wishes to cause harm by degrading multiple people at once. The hostile tone and context further support this classification.

1. Implication: The label of normal signifies that the tweet does not contain hate speech or overtly offensive language. While it expresses dissatisfaction, the tone remains casual and lighthearted.

2. Key features: There are no key derogatory terms or slurs targeting a specific group. The user expresses frustration with sizing but in an innocuous way.

3. Target: No specific group is targeted by name or implication. The reference to ""skinny white bitches"" can be seen as stereotypical, but it does not perpetuate hate speech.

4. Context & tone: The language used has a casual, slightly humorous tone through the use of ""chonky belly"" and emojis like 🤩⫹. This lightheartedness prevents the text from being classified as offensive or hate speech.

5. Conclusion: In summary, while this tweet may be seen as mildly stereotypical towards skinny white women, it does not rise to the level of hate speech or overtly offensive language.

The reference to ""white walkers"" appears to be a fictional term rather than an actual group being targeted with hate or offensive language.

Key points:
- The lack of derogatory terms, inflammatory rhetoric, or controversial subject matter keeps the text neutral.
- Without context, it's difficult to determine whether the white walkers are real people being criticized. However, no hateful slurs are used and ethnic groups aren't referenced.

The tone seems to be one of frustration rather than hate speech or a major offense. The user appears upset about undeserved passage being granted without resistance by maugs (likely referring to Maggy in Game of Thrones). 

In conclusion, this tweet does not contain the critical features of hate speech or offensive language targeting a specific group, and thus is classified as normal based on the lack of harmful intent or derogatory content.

The offensive language and slur perpetuate harmful stereotypes against sexual minorities and create a hostile environment. The blatant hatred expressed makes the impact on the target group even more damaging to their wellbeing and safety. Overall, this text violates hate speech criteria due to its clear intent of discrimination, harm and offense towards LGBTQ+ individuals through targeted slurs and derogatory language.

- The focus on economic empowerment for Africans without using derogatory terms about white individuals.
- No explicit calls to harm or discriminate against a particular race or religion. 
- Overall the message appears to be more geared toward promoting financial opportunity rather than perpetuating hate speech.

The tone seems more constructive than malicious, aiming to promote opportunity and progress over inciting racial animosity.

3. The user's casual mention of ""giving the same answer for thousands of years"" implies that this prejudice is longstanding and common.
4. The text targets both Jews (antisemitic slur) and Hispanics/Hispanic-Americans (""spick""), making it a hate speech.

The text is categorized as hate speech due to its usage of a racial slur (""nigger"") in reference to African people on the field. This term is a well-known derogatory epithet used to dehumanize and demean individuals based on race.
Key Features:
- The use of ""niggers"" - an explicit racial slur with a long history of hate speech.
Target: 
The target group appears to be African people, specifically those involved in the activity described (""them big ass niggers on the field""). This implies that they were targeted and disparaged using this language.
Tone & Context:
The tone is disparaging and dehumanizing. The phrase ""did all the work"" trivializes their role while emphasizing their physical appearance as a means of denigration. This context and term usage supports its classification as hate speech.

Conclusion: 
This text uses an explicit, well-known racial slur to demean a specific group based on race. Its tone and disparaging nature perpetuate harmful stereotypes in a targeted manner.

The language used targets Islam and refugees, painting them in a negative light with generalizing slurs. The use of such hate speech is highly offensive and perpetuates stereotypes against an ethnic/religious minority.

Contextually, this text appears as a response to the government allowing Muslim refugees into the country. The vehement hatred and aggression expressed towards these groups aligns with the classification as hate speech.

The overall tone and intent behind the discriminatory language justifies its categorization as hate speech targeting Muslims and refugee communities.

In conclusion, based on key features like ethnic slurs, generalizing stereotypes, and the clear intent to offend a religious group, this text is classified as hate speech. The derogatory nature of the targeted language used in describing the religious minority perpetuates stereotypes and discrimination.",13.33

- While women are mentioned with the term ""hoes"", it does not use derogatory slurs and is used in a non-derogatory way to describe the group.
- The post's message and tone do not intend harm or offense. It appears to be discussing the music choices of some individuals without discriminatory intent.

Overall, this tweet does not contain hate speech, offensive language or intent to harm any individual/group. Its message about cleanliness and avoidance of infection makes it a normal, innocuous post without malicious content or impact on the target group of women as perceived.",9.79

The post is simply expressing a fashion preference without targeting any particular group or containing explicit language that would warrant an offensive or hate speech label.

The slur's extreme offensiveness and history of harm to African Americans makes this tweet an egregious example of race-based hatred.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- ""Nigger"" is one of the most offensive words used against black people
- It targets a specific racial group with intent to demean and dehumanize them 
- The rest of the text trivializes the slur's harm, implying it doesn't even matter if someone has lips

The tone and intent behind this language is clearly meant to offend the African community. Its context as a ""joke"" does nothing to change its hate speech nature.

In conclusion, based on the blatant use of an egregious racial slur with clear malice towards African people, this post is unmistakably hate speech aimed at demeaning a group based on race. The features all support this classification and the text's only purpose is causing harm to that community in a derogatory manner. This earns it a ""hate speech"" label without reservation.

I would add that this sort of language has no place or justification in society under any circumstances due to its clear intent to demean and dehumanize an entire race of people based on their ethnicity. Its use should be condemned across the board as morally reprehensible hate speech, regardless of context. The fact it could be used so casually highlights how far we still have to go in terms of racial reconciliation.

Summary: The tweet appears to be a statement about England's football team with no clear harm or offense.

Key Features:
- No explicit language or slurs are used.
- It discusses England, but in an innocuous manner without derrogatory remarks.
- The tone seems informative rather than malicious.

Target Group:
No specific group is targeted by the text. It appears to be a general statement about the England football team.

Context and Tone:
The context of the post does not convey hate or offense. Rather, it reads as an innocuous remark without any clear negative intent or malice towards any individual or group.

Conclusion: Based on the lack of derogatory language, offensive tone, or specific targeting of a particular group, this text is classified as normal rather than hate speech or offensive content.

The key features of rudeness and discrimination against a particular group are present but the severity of the offense is minimized by the generality of the statement, lacking specific slurs.

The target of the statement appears to be an individual with homophobic and transphobic views who was also rude. However, no explicit harm or intent is shown to be directed at any protected class here. The rudeness seems more aimed at the individual's character rather than their identity.

In conclusion, while discrimination exists in this scenario as targeted against specific groups, its presentation lacks the severity of hate speech. With no use of slurs and the focus being on the individual's views/actions rather than just existence, this is classified as normal due to a lack of severe harm or intent.

The context is missing information but based on the content provided, it can be concluded that while the person is discriminatory, their actions are not egregious enough to qualify as hate speech. The rudeness and transphobic/homophobic views are certainly offensive but do not meet the threshold for hate speech in this case given the generalities of the statement and lack of slurs/explicit abuse.",15.3

Summary: The text contains derogatory language and slurs targeting multiple groups.

Target Group(s):
The targets include:
1. Individuals with cognitive disabilities
2. Muslims and those who practice Islam  
3. People from the United Kingdom, including ethnic minorities

Context & Intent: 
The text makes discriminatory statements about an entire region's population using offensive slurs, religious epithets and ableist language. The intention is to offend, disparage and dehumanize multiple groups.

- The text targets African people as a whole by invoking false and harmful tropes like black people being unmarriageable or not capable of building the pyramids without space ships. This is clearly aimed at an audience, but the tweet also engages with this imagined ""you"" to be fake liberation.

- Finally, the context of the text includes conspiracy theories and the invocation of a historical figure known for hate in order to demean black people. This combination of factors shows a clear intent to dehumanize and disparage African people as a group.

There are no specific targets mentioned, but the implication is that this behavior applies broadly to women. The tone of the tweet also has an accusatory nature, implying judgement.

The context of describing a false image versus reality with regard to how people present themselves (especially women) compounds the offensive effect as well. It creates a disparaging stereotype about the authenticity and honesty of some groups.

4. Context and tone: The brevity and casual language used here (""i think..."") point to the user's genuine intent of forming a welcoming social space for the targeted group.

5. Conclusion: Given the lack of harm, discrimination or offense, as well as the neutral, inclusive nature of this text as analyzed above, I conclude it is indeed normal in nature. The classification is justified by an examination of all key factors and the overall tone presented.

To summarize, while the text may reference a specific group, its message remains one of acceptance and friendliness without any derogatory or hateful content.",14.67

Key features include the use of the slur ""pakis"" in reference to the Pakistani people, as well as the term ""moslem dotheads,"" which perpetuates negative stereotypes of Muslims.

This text directly targets two groups with a history of discrimination - Pakistanis (a common term for people from Pakistan) and Muslims. The hateful language used aims to dehumanize these groups through slurs and stereotyping. 

The offensive tone and intent to harm, demean, or provoke further violence against the targeted communities justifies its classification as hate speech. The text actively discriminates against individuals based on their race, religion, nationality, or place of origin.

In conclusion, the discriminatory language targeting Pakistanis and Muslims in this post makes it categorizable as hate speech. Its derogatory features and intent to provoke harm justify this label according to our analysis framework.",12.25

Classification: Offensive

1. The text discusses a controversial political issue and expresses concerns about potential opposition to an ""anti-sexual violence bill"". This indicates the tweet addresses a sensitive topic of sexual assault.

2. Key features include the mention of ""rape"" and its differentiation from marital sex, implying harmful stereotypes and ignorance towards victims.

3. While no specific group is targeted by name, the language used references gendered violence, which historically impacts women more frequently than men. This could be seen as a microaggression.

4. The tone appears concerned rather than overtly hateful, but the discussion of rape in an insensitive manner perpetuates harmful attitudes towards victims and survivors.

5. In conclusion, while not hate speech, this tweet uses language that trivializes sexual assault and may cause harm to those with trauma from such events. This justifies its classification as offensive due to the explicit content and implications about gendered violence.

Key points:
- The comparison between whiteface clowns and blackface minstrel shows ignores the harm caused by the latter's racist stereotypes.
- The text's casual tone discussing these sensitive historical contexts is offensive in itself.

The text expresses appreciation for being referred to with certain terms that some may find offensive. However, the tone of the post indicates acceptance and lack of harm.

The tweet expresses an opinion on immigration but does not contain explicit slurs, targeted derogatory language, or discriminatory vitriol aimed at a specific ethnic, religious, or minority group.

Key points that support this classification:
- The message conveys disagreement with refugee policies and expresses frustration 
- It uses the term ""illegal aliens"" which some would find offensive
- However it does not contain overt hate speech or targeted attacks on an ethnicity, religion, etc.
- The tone is contentious rather than violent/offensive

The intent appears to be political commentary over immigration policies rather than a malicious attack. While the language used may offend some people, its impact and tone do not quite meet the threshold for hate speech or explicit offense.

In summary, while this post takes a hard stance on immigration, it does not cross the line into obvious hate speech or offense in spite of using controversial terms like ""illegal aliens."" Its political message is contentious but not overtly malicious.",13.23

This text does not contain any hate speech or offensive language. While it does express a critical tone towards someone who talked negatively about the author on Twitter, the response is more of an assertive nature than malicious intent to offend or provoke. 

The key features here are the use of ""shit"" and calling the other person a bitch. However, in context, these are not targeted at any specific group but rather used as general insults to respond to perceived disrespect.

There is no clear target specified by race, religion, gender, sexual orientation etc. The author seems to be lashing out at someone who spoke about them in an undesirable way, but the language is fairly tame and more assertive than offensive or hateful.

In conclusion, this post is normal as it does not rise to the level of hate speech with its lack of targeting language at protected groups.

This text is classified as neutral, even though it uses a racial slur (""niggers"") and references discriminatory treatment towards both Irish and Africans. The key features are:

1) Historical context - This implies the speaker acknowledges different standards of treatment in the past.

2) Comparing treatment - The tweet compares how ""atleast [the Irish] were white"" to African slavery. 

3) ""Different right?"" - This rhetorical question frames the comparison as unreasonable, questioning how past discrimination could be dismissed.

4) Slave conditions - The phrase highlights the severity of Africans' treatment.

In context, the tone is more reflective than derogatory or offensive. It's commenting on double standards in history rather than targeting a group with hate speech. While it uses problematic language, the overall message is more informative than hurtful. So while very insensitive to use that term, this doesn't seem maliciously targeted at any group.",14.74

This text is classified as hate speech due to its targeting of multiple groups through the use of derogatory language and graphic descriptions of violence.

The tweet contains a litany of violent acts including bombing, shooting, and sinking, with references to New Orleans, ""the dyke,"" Arab children, Dresden, and Iraq. The use of such explicit imagery is highly offensive and harmful, especially when linked to specific groups.

Key points that support this classification:
- The text targets Jewish people through the use of an anti-Semitic slur (""jews"").
- It also references women with a derogatory term (""dyke""). 
- Arab children are targeted by the mention of ""shooting"" them.
- Dresden and Iraq are referenced in association with bombing, implying harm towards those locations.

The tone is one of hostility rather than factual or neutral description. The intent appears to be inciting hate through associating these groups with violent acts. 

In conclusion, this text's derogatory language, graphic violence, and targeting of specific groups make it a clear example of hate speech that violates the standards of acceptable discourse. It perpetuates harm and prejudice towards the referenced groups.",14.62

The tweet targets Islam and refugees by accusing them of an ""invasion"" and implying malicious intent behind their migration. It also implies that Muslims are given leniency (""lenience"") for crimes due to their faith, portraying them as receiving special treatment.

The tone is one of conspiracy and xenophobia towards the Muslim population, using loaded terms like invasion to incite hostility towards the group. The user's intent seems to be perpetuating anti-Islamic stereotypes by associating migration with a malicious ""moslem"" invasion that receives undue protection.

In conclusion, this tweet falls under hate speech due to its derogatory language targeting Muslims and refugees, portraying them as an invading force receiving special privileges.

3. By posting this, the user is clearly intending to offend and disparage Africans through using a well-known slur in a derogatory manner.

**Hate Speech**
- The tweet_text categorizes as hate speech due to its extreme offensiveness and discriminatory language targeting religious minorities. Key words like ""dirty"" and ""muzzies""/""kikes"" are used derogatorily to degrade Muslims/Jews.
- The offensive analogy of ""muzzies and oil is like kikes and gold"" perpetuates negative stereotypes of these groups. 
- The context of attempting to make friends while referencing genocide (cremating Jews) with a derogatory term for Muslims demonstrates malicious intent.
- Overall, the tweet utilizes hate speech to degrade entire religious groups in a highly offensive manner.

The blatant use of discriminatory terms and imagery targeting religious minorities makes this text classify as hate speech. Its malicious tone and derogatory context solidify its classification despite the mention of friendship.

The tone and context further affirm this classification by implying violence against a public figure perceived as working for or representing the Jewish community, using language that incites hatred.

The tweet's implication that an individual of this race can make others look bad by association is a blatant example of discriminatory language targeting an ethnic group with malicious intent.

Key features like the N-word are essential to the hate speech label, as they perpetuate harmful stereotypes and cause considerable offense to the target racial group. There is no benign interpretation for such slurs and their usage in this context, especially when combined with the implication that a person's race can reflect poorly on others.

The text makes reference to an African person negatively impacting a larger group with which they are associated, implying guilt by association based solely on race. This kind of racial stereotyping is at the heart of hate speech and why it is so problematic - it assigns blame and scorn to an entire group based on one individual's actions.

The text does not contain any hate speech or offensive language targeted at a specific group. While it references an individual being disqualified due to their behavior, the message is more of a neutral nature rather than one meant to harm or perpetuate stereotypes. 

There are no key features that suggest this tweet is intended to offend or promote derogatory attitudes. The mention of Nigerian people and their attitude seems more like a general observation made by the author rather than as an intent to offend.

The target of disapproval is the individual's behavior rather than any group they may identify with. There is no clear victim or malice evident in this post.

Taking all factors into account, I assess the text as being generally neutral and lacking malicious intent. It does not cross thresholds for hate speech or offensive language. The context is more akin to an observation of behavior rather than a purposeful attack on any group.

2. No derogatory terms: Key features like explicit slurs are absent from the text, preventing it from being labeled offensive.

3. General discussion: The tone and content focus on a political topic (impeachment) without harmfully referencing a specific group. This keeps it in the normal category.

4. Focus on rebuilding: Rather than perpetuating violence or hate, the author expresses a need to ""rebuild"" respect, implying a constructive intent.

5. Mention of science: The reference to investing in science as part of this rebuilding process further supports a normal classification by referencing a positive goal.

This text is classified as hate speech due to its use of the derogatory racial slur ""nigger"" and its application in a mocking manner when referencing music. The key features, including the slur targeting people of African descent and the belittling tone towards their cultural products, support this classification.

The term ""nigger"" is an explicit racist slur historically used as a dehumanizing epitaph against Black people. Its usage perpetuates discrimination, harm, and marginalization that hate speech seeks to inflict upon its targets. The casual use of this slur in the context of music, which holds cultural significance for many African communities, further intensifies its hateful intent.

The text's tone is also deeply mocking and disrespectful towards African individuals as well as their creative expressions and artistic works. By using a term synonymous with hate speech to trivialize another group's culture, it perpetuates ethnic supremacy and racial animus.

In conclusion, the combination of a notorious slur with disparaging remarks aimed at an entire race, coupled with its belittling tone, affirm this text's classification as hate speech that explicitly targets and degrades people of African descent. Its intent is to offend and its language is undeniably hateful by any standard.",15.19

- The usage of the term ""moslems"" in a dismissive manner, implying an entire religious group.
- Proposing to apply special rules based on a person's religion without justification or context. This targets Muslims and suggests they should be singled out.

This tone implies hostility towards Muslims, especially Muslim women, as it references their beliefs without regard for their rights. The discriminatory intent behind the text makes it a clear case of hate speech aimed at religious minorities.

- The tweet uses derogatory slurs like ""nigger"" in a discriminatory manner. This targets individuals of African descent with an intention of degrading them.
- It also employs ableist language by referring to someone's IQ level as ""low"", perpetuating harmful stereotypes about intelligence.
- Most prominently, it explicitly endorses violence against another religious group (""kill the kuffar""), which is a hate speech identifier.
- The target of this hate speech is clearly Buddhists (Kuffar) as well as Africans in general. This attacks their beliefs and identities.

The tone and context, mentioning being able to ""understand"" the call for violence based on perceived understanding of Islam, further justify this classification. The user's intent appears to be inciting religious bigotry and harm.

- Suggesting it's best if children ""never see their dads"" after divorce is an inflammatory statement. 
- Referring to a ""fag and dyke families"" uses derogatory terms to describe LGBTQ+ parents.
The tone seems dismissive of the challenges faced by refugee families and some family arrangements.

While not containing overt hate speech, this tweet's insensitive phrasing perpetuates harm towards refugees, divorcees, and LGBTQ+ individuals.

This tweet is classified as hate speech due to its use of a derogatory slur aimed at the Jewish community. The key feature ""kike"" is a well-known ethnic slur used to target individuals of Jewish descent.

The tweet references a group (Jewish) and implies they are acting as ""perverts"". This targets a specific religious group in a derogatory manner, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and discriminatory language. 

The tone and intent also support this classification. Rather than simply expressing disagreement or offense with the group, the user employs a slur to dehumanize and demean Jewish individuals.

The label of ""normal"" is justified given the context-free nature of this brief remark. Despite containing a racially derogatory term ""nigger"", it's used ambiguously to speculate on someone based on their name alone without any targeted malice or intent.

Key features like the racial slur are not used in an explicitly hateful way here, but more as a vague descriptor for someone unknown, supporting the neutral classification. Without clear evidence of harm toward a specific group or user intent to offend, this cannot be classified as hate speech even with the presence of such language. The casual and uncertain tone further justify it being considered simply ""normal"" discourse.

In conclusion, while this remark contains questionable language, its use in an ambiguous context without malicious targeting prevents it from being classified as either hate speech or offensive. The overall neutral and speculative nature of the comment supports a normal classification with no clear harm caused to any group based on race, religion, orientation, etc., even if that word would be considered offensive in most cases if used in a more directed manner.",13.4

The key feature supporting this classification is the use of the term 'mudshark', a highly offensive slur aimed at black men who date white women. Its usage perpetuates negative stereotypes about interracial relationships and racial groups.

The target groups referenced are African, Islam, None (women), all of whom are disparaged through the implication that white women ""worship"" black men to get material benefits with little effort.

The tone is one of disparagement and contempt for these groups. The intent appears to be a hateful generalization of black men as manipulators preying on white women's choices in society.

In conclusion, this tweet earns an offensive label due to its targeted use of derogatory language against specific racial and religious groups in the context of gender dynamics. The slur 'mudshark' is a hate term that perpetuates negative stereotypes, justifying this classification based on the text's content, impact, and tone towards the targeted demographics referenced.",13.25

- ""Nigger"" - a highly offensive slur used as a pejorative
- ""Stupid"" - disparaging term applied to the comedian

The text is directed at an African American, using slurs to demean and denigrate based on race. This perpetuates harmful stereotypes. 

The tone is hostile and dismissive of the comedian's viewpoint in defending NFL players who protested against systemic racism.

- Key points include the usage of the n-word (a well-known slur), and other disparaging language aimed at black people's skin tone, facial features, and hair texture.
- The comparison of these women to mutants further perpetuates stereotypes and dehumanizes them. 
- This tweet contains multiple slurs and insults aimed directly at African women in an offensive manner.

In conclusion, the text crosses the threshold into hate speech due to its overtly discriminatory language targeting a specific race and gender group with the intent to offend or dehumanize.",9.09

Key features that support this neutral classification include:
- A general discussion about refugees and their acceptance in India 
- No use of derogatory terms, discriminatory language, or hate speech
- The context relates to political and social issues rather than personal attacks

The text's tone appears informative and lacks an intent to offend or disparage any group. It references a UN refugee treaty and the developing state of India as it pertains to accepting refugees.

While the discussion of a sensitive topic could be seen as potentially offensive, there is no evidence in this text to suggest it aims to harm or disparage based on race, religion, nationality, etc. As such, its neutrality and lack of controversial features justify classifying it as normal without any hate speech or offensive content.",11.24

1. Label implication: The classification of 'normal' indicates that the text does not contain explicit hate speech or offensive language. It appears to be a factual comment with no derogatory terms.

2. Key features: No specific key words support the classification of hate speech or offense. There are no discriminatory slurs, profanity, or inciting language.

3. Target analysis: The target 'none' suggests that the text is not directly aimed at any particular group to offend them. It appears to be a general political comment rather than a personal attack.

4. Context and intent: The tone is critical of the president's policies but without malice or hate. It does not glorify violence, discrimination or genocide against an ethnic group like some definitions of hate speech require.

5. Conclusion: Based on the lack of targeted offensive language, derogatory terms and the absence of a clear target group to offend, this text is classified as normal political commentary rather than hate speech. While it may be critical in nature, it does not cross the threshold into explicit hate speech or offense.

The slur is used in an attempt to diminish Jesus's identity and undermine Christianity, implying that it originated from an inferior cult related to Judaism.

This usage of hateful language aims to debase an entire religious group (Jews) and its beliefs. The intention to offend or disparage a specific ethnic minority or religion supports the hate speech label. The slur is not used as a neutral statement but as a means to ridicule or harm, which categorizes it as hate speech.

The reference to Jesus in this context perpetuates anti-Semitic stereotypes by implying that Judaism was inferior and responsible for the ""origin"" of Christianity. This discriminatory comment violates the inclusive nature of religious discussions and incites prejudice against an ethnic minority group.

Given the offensive language used to target a specific religion and ethnicity, combined with the disparaging tone directed at both Jews and Christians, this text meets all criteria for hate speech. The intent is clearly to offend through discriminatory slurs rather than engage in open discussion, hence it must be categorized as hate speech based on these key features of targeting an ethnic minority group through derogatory language and a harmful tone.",15.23

1. Label implication: The label of ""normal"" indicates a neutral classification without hate speech or offensive content.

2. Key features: There are no key features in this analysis that would suggest hate speech or offensive content. The use of ""<user>"" and ""<number>"" does not imply any harmful or derogatory language targeted at a specific group.

3. Targeted groups: The text appears to be directed towards an individual (""<user>"") rather than a collective target (e.g., a race, religion, etc.), making it more of a personal nature.

4. Context and tone: The emojis used convey a playful tone, especially the ""<number>"" hoe with the repeating emojis. This suggests a lighthearted, possibly humorous intent on the part of the user rather than any malicious or derogatory purposes.

5. Conclusion: Based on the lack of targeted slurs or hate speech directed towards a specific group, combined with the playful tone and context surrounding ""<user>"" and ""<number>"", this text can be justified as normal without any harmful implications or offensive language.

The text is classified as hate speech due to its use of the slur ""nigger"" and its implication that two individuals, presumably celebrities, are in some way lovers with black people. 

Key features:
- ""Nigger"" is an extremely offensive racial epithet used to dehumanize and debase African-Americans.
- The term's use in this context implies promiscuity with a targeted racial group.

Target group: 
The text explicitly targets the African race, using a slur that has long been associated with white supremacist ideology. It demeans black people as subhuman, implying they are sexually promiscuous and debased.

Intent:
The tone is derisive and demeaning towards the individuals mentioned (mr markle and cunt harry). The use of this epithet to describe their alleged sexual partners is a form of hate speech targeting African-Americans. 

Conclusion: 
This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit use of a long-standing racial slur, the dehumanization and debasement of African-Americans through promiscuity, and its derogatory tone towards individuals associated with the targeted group.",14.34

While the term ""nigger"" has a problematic history and is often considered a racial slur, its usage here seems to be as an endearment without discriminatory intent.

The key features point list is empty, indicating that no specific words or phrases stood out as contributing factors for the classification. This absence of contentious elements is what supports this text's neutral categorization.

There is no clear target group being referenced by the language used in the tweet either. The term ""nigger"" was historically used to denigrate African Americans but its casual usage here doesn't seem targeted at any racial or religious group.

In terms of context, the tone appears more playful than malicious, suggesting that this text is not meant to offend or harm. Without any derogatory language aimed at a specific group, and given the lack of problematic key features supporting hate speech, the classification of ""normal"" fits based on the absence of clear offensive elements and discriminatory intent.

In conclusion, while the term ""nigger"" has a controversial history and could be seen as offensive by some, its usage here does not appear malicious or targeted at any specific group. Without contentious language or discriminatory intent behind it, this text's classification as ""normal"" is justified based on its context and lack of problematic features that would support hate speech or offensive categorizations.",17.03
