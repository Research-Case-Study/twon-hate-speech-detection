""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers.

The tweet expresses a critical view on what is perceived as 'rape culture' and attributes the lack of understanding or action against it to individuals in positions of power who are predominantly white males. While the statement is strong and accusatory, it does not cross into hate speech because it does not directly incite violence or hatred towards all individuals belonging to those groups (Caucasian, Men). Instead, it criticizes a specific subset of these groups – those holding higher positions – for their supposed inability to comprehend issues related to rape culture. This criticism is grounded in social and political commentary rather than baseless derogation. However, the generalization could be seen as offensive by some since it assumes all white males in power share the same lack of understanding or empathy regarding these issues.",107.84

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

This statement does not contain any overtly hateful or offensive language but rather a critical commentary on the perceived insensitivity of certain individuals to the issue of rape culture.

Rape culture refers to the societal norms and practices that normalize, condone, or even trivialize sexual violence. It is essential to acknowledge that the tweet's intention is not to demean or discriminate against any individual based on their race or gender but rather to call attention to a complex societal issue and express disappointment with those who seem unable to comprehend it.

The absence of key features like slurs, threats, or epithets further supports the classification of this tweet as neutral. Instead, the content is more akin to a social commentary, expressing a critical opinion on a societal issue and the perceived lack of understanding among certain individuals.

This tweet serves as an important reminder that hate speech analysis requires careful consideration of context and user intent. In this case, while the statement may express frustration and criticism, it does not contain any overtly discriminatory or prejudiced language.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the user's intent is not to incite hate or offend, but rather to critique and bring attention to a serious social issue, namely rape culture. The key features are not explicitly listed, but phrases such as ""rape culture"" and ""higher ups"" who are ""all white males"" suggest that the user is highlighting a systemic problem and the lack of representation and understanding among those in power. The target groups mentioned are Caucasian and men, but the tone is not one of attack or derogation; rather, it is a critique of the privilege and disconnect that can come with being part of a dominant group. The context and tone of the post suggest that the user is expressing frustration and concern about the perpetuation of rape culture and the inability of those in positions of power to understand and address it.

Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

Although the tweet targets Caucasian men, suggesting they are out of touch due to their race and gender, it does not promote hate or violence towards them but rather critiques a systemic issue perceived to be perpetuated by this demographic's dominance in positions of power. The context suggests the user's intention is to highlight and condemn rape culture, pointing out what they see as a flaw in the system - the inability of those in charge to empathize with or understand the experiences of others due to their privileged background. This tweet does not contain hate speech but rather a critical commentary on societal issues and power structures. The classification as ""normal"" (which might be interpreted as neutral in this context) seems appropriate because, despite the tweet's critique of a specific group based on race and gender, its primary aim is to address a perceived social injustice rather than to demean or discriminate against individuals based on their identity factors. The absence of key features listed may indicate that the tweet's language, while critical, does not cross into pejorative or discriminatory speech towards an individual or group in a way that would classify it as hate speech or offensive content.",103.7

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 2: Key features like ""evil"" and ""muzrat cult"" express a negative and derogatory attitude towards the Islamic community. The term ""muzrat"" is a derogatory term used to refer to Muslims, which is offensive and disrespectful.

Step 3: The target is the Islamic community, which is stigmatized and stereotyped in this statement. By labeling them as an ""evil cult,"" the text implies that all members of this faith are evil and deserve contempt.

Step 4: The overall context and tone suggest a biased and hostile attitude towards the Islamic community, which could potentially incite harm or violence. The use of inflammatory language and derogatory terms is intended to dehumanize and marginalize the targeted group.

Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its offensive and discriminatory language, which is explicitly targeted towards the Islamic community. It perpetuates harmful stereotypes and stigmatizes an entire religious group, and could potentially incite harm or violence against individuals who practice this faith.",19.69

Furthermore, the mention of ""gov t complicity"" suggests a conspiracy theory that implies government involvement or endorsement of alleged wrongdoing by Muslims, which can fuel further prejudice and hostility.

The use of the word ""cult"" to describe Islam is also offensive because it implies that the religion is not a legitimate or recognized faith but rather an extremist or fringe group. This kind of language contributes to the dehumanization and marginalization of Muslim individuals and communities, fostering an environment of fear, mistrust, and discrimination.

Overall, the statement's intention appears to be inflammatory, aiming to provoke anger and reinforce negative attitudes toward Muslims and Islam, which aligns with the characteristics of hate speech.",82.06

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

This statement is categorized as hate speech due to its use of derogatory language (""muzrat"") and vilification of Islam, which is described as an ""evil cult."" The term ""muzrat"" is a pejorative and dehumanizing slur targeting Muslims.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Now, write an explanation for the given input using this reasoning framework.
","{'post_id': '25290089_gab', 'tweet_text': 'wonder what fatso had for dinner today lollers roanna fish pie i think', 'key_features': [], 'target': 'None, Other', 'label': 'normal'}"," Reasoning:

Step 1: The label is normal, which indicates that the content does not contain hate speech or offensive language.

Step 2: There are no key features provided in this tweet that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.

Step 3: The text appears to be a casual comment about someone else's food preferences and does not target any specific group or individual. The term ""fatso"" could be perceived as derogatory if used with malicious intent towards another person, but in this context, it seems more like a colloquial term used casually and likely directed at the hypothetical person being discussed rather than a real individual.

Step 4: The tone of the tweet is generally light-hearted and playful, as indicated by the use of the emoji ""lollers."" Additionally, the comment seems to be about food preferences rather than personally attacking or harming someone, making it unlikely that the user intended to offend.

Step 5: In conclusion, this text is classified as normal because it lacks hate speech and offensive language, does not target a specific group or individual, and appears to have been written with a lighthearted tone rather than an intentionally harmful one. The absence of clear key features and the friendly context further support this classification.",20.27

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Although there are no explicitly identified key features, the use of colloquial and informal language, such as ""fatso"" and ""lollers"", suggests a casual and potentially teasing tone. The target is listed as ""None, Other"", implying that while the text may refer to an individual or group, it does not specifically target a protected or vulnerable class. Examining the context and tone, the user's intent appears to be lighthearted and humorous, with the mention of ""roanna fish pie"" adding a playful touch. However, it's worth noting that the term ""fatso"" can be considered derogatory and body-shaming in certain contexts. Despite this, the overall classification as ""normal"" suggests that the text is not deemed to cross the threshold into hate speech or severe offensiveness, likely due to its informal and joking nature, and the lack of clear malice or intent to harm. Therefore, the text is classified as ""normal"" because, despite some potentially problematic language, it is ultimately seen as a casual and non-aggressive post, with the user's intent being more playful than harmful.",101.14

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers.

However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals.

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals. 
","{'post_id': '25290089_gab', 'tweet_text': 'wonder what fatso had for dinner today lollers roanna fish pie i think', 'key_features': [], 'target': 'None, Other', 'label': 'normal'}","Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled as normal; however, the language used can be considered borderline offensive due to the use of derogatory terms such as 'fatso.' While it appears to be a light-hearted comment about someone's dinner choice, the use of the term 'fatso' is pejorative and can be seen as body-shaming. The context suggests that the user might know the individual they are referring to ('wonder what fatso had for dinner today'), but without any explicit harmful intent or direct targeting based on protected characteristics like race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation, it's categorized as normal. It does not meet the criteria for hate speech since it doesn't incite violence or hatred against a specific group; however, its offensive nature is notable and could potentially cause distress to the individual being referred to. The casual use of derogatory terms in seemingly harmless contexts can still contribute to a culture that normalizes disrespect and body-shaming.",109.76

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.

The term ""dyke"" is particularly noteworthy, as it is a slur often used to derogate lesbian women. The target of the tweet, ""Homosexual, Women"", further supports the hate speech label, as the language used is specifically designed to degrade and intimidate members of these groups.

The tweet is labeled as hate speech because it uses derogatory language to target and demean individuals based on their sexual orientation (""dyke"") and gender (""women""). The term ""dyke"" is a pejorative slang for a lesbian, and when used in this context, it's intended to be offensive and dehumanizing. Additionally, the descriptors ""angry"" and ""bald"" seem to be used to further mock or belittle the individual, implying that these characteristics are negative or unappealing.

The use of such language contributes to a hostile environment for LGBTQ+ individuals and women, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases. The combination of these words in this tweet creates a derogatory and demeaning tone, which is characteristic of hate speech. The intention behind the tweet appears to be to insult, intimidate, or marginalize the targeted group, rather than to engage in constructive dialogue or respectful discussion.

In the context of hate speech, this tweet meets the criteria because it:

1. Uses pejorative language (""dyke"") that is historically and culturally offensive to a specific group (LGBTQ+ individuals).
2. Targets individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender.
3. Conveys a derogatory and demeaning tone, intended to belittle or mock the targeted group.

- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.

1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.

   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.

","{'post_id': '20179103_gab', 'tweet_text': 'angry bald dyke', 'key_features': ['angry', 'bald', 'dyke'], 'target': 'Homosexual, Women', 'label': 'hatespeech'}"," Reasoning:

Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or hostility against a specific group.

Step 2: Key features like ""angry,"" ""bald,"" and ""dyke"" contribute to this classification. The term ""angry"" can be perceived as an attempt to demean the target group by implying they are inherently angry or volatile. ""Bald"" could be seen as a derogatory remark, especially when used as an insult towards individuals who do not conform to societal standards of attractiveness or masculinity. The term ""dyke,"" which is historically and presently used as a homophobic slur against lesbians, directly targets the homosexual and women community.

Step 3: The target group in this instance includes both homosexual individuals and women, who are negatively characterized through these offensive terms.

Step 4: The context and tone of the text are negative, as the words used have historically been used to belittle, demean, and discriminate against members of the LGBTQ+ community. The user intentionally chooses these hateful slurs to express their disdain for this group.

Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit use of derogatory terms aimed at targeting a specific group - homosexual individuals and women. By using offensive language, the text intends to harm and belittle members of the LGBTQ+ community.",22.04

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

This statement is classified as hate speech for several reasons. Firstly, the use of the term ""dindu"" is a pejorative and racially charged slang that targets African Americans, particularly in contexts where they are accused of criminal behavior. This term has emerged from internet cultures and is often used to mock concerns about racism and police brutality.

Secondly, the phrase ""homo violence episodes"" and ""gays are fond of carrying fat rolls of cash"" perpetuates harmful stereotypes about homosexual individuals, portraying them as both victims and targets due to their presumed wealth. This kind of language not only contributes to homophobia but also implies that violence against this group is somehow justified or expected.

The statement further escalates its hateful tone by suggesting actions meant to provoke ""cognitive dissonance"" in the community it refers to as ""gay msm,"" which likely stands for Men who have Sex with Men, a term often used in public health contexts. By proposing to ""drop leaflets on Chicago splaining that gays are fond of carrying fat rolls of cash,"" the author implies an intent to spread misinformation and incite tension or violence against homosexual individuals.

Lastly, the reference to ""media queers"" is both homophobic and derogatory toward queer people working in media, further solidifying this statement's classification as hate speech. The suggestion that these individuals will wake up in a log cabin with questions implies a desire for a dramatic change in their circumstances, perhaps reflecting an extremist ideology or desire to see harm come to the LGBTQ+ community.

In summary, this tweet uses racial slurs, promotes violence against and stereotypes of homosexual individuals, and targets members of the media who are part of the queer community. The overall message is one that seeks to incite fear, spread misinformation, and escalate tensions between different groups, making it a clear example of hate speech.",210.68

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

This statement is classified as hate speech because it contains several elements that promote hatred and violence towards specific groups.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Now, write an explanation for the given input using this reasoning framework.

Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.

Step 2: Key features such as ""smelly,"" ""kike,"" and ""lynching"" express a clear call for harm and hate directed towards the Jewish community. The use of derogatory terms like ""smelly kike"" dehumanizes and stereotypes members of this group, while ""lynching"" implies an intention to physically harm or even kill.

Step 3: The target is explicitly stated as ""Jewish,"" making this statement particularly harmful towards people belonging to that community.

Step 4: The context and tone are violent and threatening, with a public call for retribution against the individual identified in the photo. This text can be seen as encouraging and inciting violence against an entire group based on their religious identity.

   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses derogatory terms and hateful language targeting a Jewish individual. The use of the term ""kike"" is an offensive slur used historically to demean and dehumanize Jewish people. Additionally, labeling someone as a ""degenerate"" and associating them with promoting ""smut and porn"" serves to vilify and stigmatize the targeted user, potentially inciting hatred or violence against them based on their perceived behavior linked to their identity. The term ""diversity kike,"" in this context, appears to be an attempt to further marginalize Jewish individuals by suggesting they are disingenuously aligning with diversity movements while hiding behind patriotism, which can foster division and prejudice among different groups. Overall, the language used in this statement is intended to demean, insult, and incite hatred against a specific individual based on their perceived ethnic or religious identity, fitting the definition of hate speech.",108.19

This statement is classified as hate speech because it contains several elements that are derogatory and discriminatory towards individuals based on their identity. The use of the term ""degenerate"" to describe someone is inherently negative, implying a lack of moral or ethical standards. Furthermore, accusing someone of promoting ""smut and porn"" without context can be seen as an attempt to shame or degrade them.

The most egregious aspect of this statement, however, is the use of the slur ""kike,"" which is a highly offensive and anti-Semitic term used to demean people of Jewish descent. The combination of this slur with accusations of hiding behind patriotism suggests that the speaker believes the targeted individual's actions or beliefs are not genuinely patriotic but rather a facade for their supposedly degenerate activities.

Additionally, the mention of ""diversity"" in a derogatory context implies that the speaker views diversity itself as negative or problematic. This kind of language contributes to a hostile environment where certain groups, in this case, Jewish individuals, feel targeted and demeaned.

The overall tone of the statement is aggressive and accusatory, with the speaker positioning themselves as morally superior while dehumanizing the target. The use of such hate speech can contribute to the normalization of discrimination and violence against targeted groups, making it a significant concern for social cohesion and respect for human dignity.",109.76

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

The user's intent behind the tweet appears to be one of condemnation and vilification, targeting an individual who they accuse of promoting ""smut"" and pornography on the platform Gab. However, the language used quickly escalates into hate speech with the use of highly derogatory terms such as ""degenerate"" repeatedly, which alone could be seen as offensive but in this context is used to dehumanize. The key feature that solidifies this tweet as hate speech is the term ""kike,"" a deeply offensive and anti-Semitic slur directed against Jewish people. This term, combined with ""diversity,"" suggests that the user is not only attacking the individual's perceived moral character but also their ethnicity or religious affiliation in a pejorative manner. The mention of ""hiding behind patriotism"" implies a belief that the targeted individual's actions are hypocritical and that their expression of patriotic sentiments is insincere, further fueling the hate speech. Given the definition of hate speech as discriminatory or pejorative towards an individual or group based on identity factors such as religion, ethnicity, or nationality, this tweet clearly falls into the hate speech category due to its use of anti-Semitic language and its targeting of a Jewish individual with derogatory slurs. The context provided by the key features supports this classification, highlighting the user's intention to demean and discriminate against the targeted group.",118.51

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Now, write an explanation for the given input using this reasoning framework.

Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite hostility or harm against a specific group. In this case, the text explicitly targets the Jewish community with derogatory and offensive language.

Step 2: Key features such as ""degenerate,"" ""diversity,"" and ""kike"" are crucial to understanding the hateful nature of this text. The repeated use of the term ""degenerate"" demeans and stigmatizes the individual being targeted, while ""diversity"" is employed as a veiled insult, implying that the person is attempting to hide their true nature behind a facade of inclusivity. The term ""kike,"" which is an antisemitic slur, serves to further vilify and dehumanize the target by invoking negative stereotypes and prejudices against Jews.

Step 3: The target of this text is the Jewish community. By using offensive language and perpetuating antisemitic tropes, the user seeks to belittle and harm individuals based on their religious identity.

Step 4: The overall context and tone of the text are hostile and derogatory, revealing an intent to spread hate and prejudice towards the Jewish community. This type of language is not only offensive but also dangerous, as it can contribute to a climate of intolerance and even violence against targeted groups.

Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit use of derogatory and offensive language targeting the Jewish community. The repeated employment of antisemitic slurs and stereotypes serves to dehumanize and vilify individuals based on their religious identity, perpetuating harmful prejudices and contributing to a climate of intolerance and potential violence.",21.12

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone.

2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

The term ""trailer trash"" is often used pejoratively to refer to people living in mobile homes, typically implying they are uneducated, poor, or unsophisticated.

Step 3: The target group is multifaceted and includes Caucasians (White people), economic backgrounds, and potentially those from rural areas. This text can be perceived as offensive to individuals who identify with any of these aspects.

Step 4: The context and tone are judgmental and dismissive, using a derogatory term to stereotype and stigmatize the target group. While the user may not have intended harm, the language they used perpetuates negative stereotypes and can be hurtful or offensive to those it refers to.

Conclusion: This text is offensive because it contains derogatory language and perpetuates a harmful stereotype about individuals from the region of Georgia, specifically those assumed to live in trailers and come from less privileged backgrounds. The use of such language can be hurtful and reinforce negative attitudes towards this group.",20.48

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist.""

This statement is labeled as offensive because it contains derogatory language and stereotypes that target a specific group based on their geographical origin (Georgia) and socioeconomic status. The phrase ""trailer trash"" is a pejorative term used to demean individuals from lower-income backgrounds, particularly those living in trailer parks, which are often associated with poverty and lack of education.

The mention of the name ""Edwina"" being uncommon or only given by ""Georgia trailer trash"" further perpetuates negative stereotypes about people from Georgia, implying that they are unsophisticated or lacking in refinement. This kind of language contributes to classism, regionalism, and prejudice against individuals based on their background.

Moreover, the tone of the statement is mocking and insulting, with the user calling out someone's supposed ""burner account"" and making a personal attack on their name and presumed background. The use of derogatory terms like ""trailer trash"" creates a hostile and discriminatory environment, making the comment offensive and inappropriate. 

The targets mentioned (""Caucasian, Economic, Other"") indicate that the offense is directed towards Caucasian individuals from a lower socioeconomic status, highlighting the intersectional nature of the prejudice.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet

- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet has been labeled as normal because it is a celebratory statement highlighting the contributions and achievements of various historical figures who were queer or had same-sex attractions. The use of the term 'queer' here does not carry a derogatory connotation but rather acknowledges their sexual orientation, which often faced societal challenges during their lifetimes. By mentioning prominent individuals across different fields - science, art, literature, military, and culture - the tweet emphasizes the significant impact of LGBT people throughout history. The use of ""fucking"" could be considered vulgar language; however, within this context, it appears to add emphasis rather than to insult or degrade any individual or group. Overall, the tone is positive and affirming, aiming to highlight diversity and excellence among the queer community.",89.17

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:

2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.

- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:

   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 2: Key features such as ""white"" and ""bitch"" are used in a demeaning way to target Caucasian women. The term ""trying to look as black as possible"" implies an assumption about the woman's intentions and an insensitive view of race.

Step 3: The target is explicitly stated as Caucasian women, making this text particularly offensive towards this group.

Step 4: The overall context and tone are derogatory, demeaning, and dismissive, with the user intending to belittle and stereotype the targeted group.

   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

This tweet has been labeled as offensive because it contains derogatory language and pejorative terms targeting Caucasians. The use of phrases such as ""bum ass caucazoids"" is demeaning and insulting, with ""bum"" and ""ass"" being used in a derogatory manner to refer to people of Caucasian descent. The term ""caucazoids"" itself is not inherently offensive, but the context in which it is used, paired with ""bum ass,"" makes it clear that the intent is to belittle or degrade.

Furthermore, the tweet's assertion that many people falsely self-identify as white due to social constructs and lack of knowledge about their native land could be seen as a commentary on issues of identity and cultural heritage. However, this message is delivered in a way that is confrontational and offensive towards Caucasians, rather than promoting understanding or dialogue.

The use of ""aka"" (also known as) before ""caucasians"" might suggest an attempt to educate or highlight the origins of the term, but given the surrounding language, it comes across more as a form of ridicule or disdain rather than an informative gesture. Overall, the tone and language used make the tweet offensive towards Caucasians, focusing on insult rather than constructive discussion about identity, history, or social constructs.",109.07

The tweet is labeled as offensive due to the use of derogatory language and the disrespectful tone towards Caucasians.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 1: The lack of a specific label such as hate speech or offensive suggests the text is innocuous and does not intend to harm or demean any group. Step 2: Despite there being no explicitly identified key features, the phrase ""white boy"" could potentially be seen as problematic out of context; however, in this case, it appears to be used in an informal, possibly affectionate manner without any derogatory intent. Step 3: The target is listed as ""None"", which supports the notion that the text does not aim to offend or target a specific group, and the phrase ""my white boy"" seems more like a term of endearment or familiarity rather than a slur. Step 4: Examining the overall context and tone, the language used (""going right to my white boy in Raleigh"") suggests a casual, personal communication, possibly about meeting up with someone, which further reinforces the idea that there's no intent to harm or offend. Conclusion: This text is classified as ""normal"" because it lacks any explicit or implicit intent to harm, offend, or demean, and the language used, although potentially sensitive out of context, appears to be used in a friendly or familiar manner without targeting any group, thus justifying its classification as non-problematic or ""normal"".",113.84

Step 2: There are no explicit key features in this text that can be linked to hate speech or offensive content. The phrase ""my white boy"" may appear to refer to a specific race, but without further context, it does not indicate any hostility or ill-intent towards the group.

Step 3: The target in this text is not clear or discernible, as it simply mentions a ""white boy"" from Raleigh with no further implication or derogatory language used.

The tweet ""going right to my white boy in Raleigh"" has been labeled normal.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

The term ""white boy"" is commonly used colloquially and does not inherently hold hate speech connotations when used without any derogatory intent. In this case, the user's intention appears to be simply identifying the demographic of their intended audience or target.

Moreover, the absence of any discriminatory or pejorative language towards a specific race, religion, ethnicity, or other identity factors in the tweet further supports its classification as neutral.

3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Now, write an explanation for the given input using this reasoning framework.

The key feature ""hoes"" is a slang term that is often used in a derogatory manner to refer to women, supporting the classification as offensive due to its objectifying and demeaning connotation. The target of this text is women, and the use of such language contributes to a culture of disrespect and misogyny, affecting this group negatively by perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Examining the overall context and tone, the intent behind the text appears to be aggressive and insulting, with the phrase ""fuck you all"" amplifying the offensive nature of the statement. The combination of this aggressive tone with the derogatory term ""hoes"" suggests a clear intent to demean and insult, rather than to engage in constructive dialogue or express a legitimate grievance. Therefore, this text is classified as offensive because it employs language that demeans and disrespects women, contributing to a hostile environment without promoting any form of hate speech that incites violence, thus distinguishing it from hate speech while still being harmful due to its derogatory content and intent.",95.64

Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

It lacks the intention to incite hate or violence, which is key to labeling content as hate speech.

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

This statement is labeled as offensive due to the use of vulgar language (""fuck you"") and a derogatory term (""hoes""). The word ""hoes"" is often used in a demeaning context, specifically targeting women. It reduces them to mere objects and disregards their personhood, leading to an overall disrespectful tone.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

The key feature ""hoes"" is a highly pejorative term that objectifies and degrades women, contributing significantly to the tweet's offensive nature. Given the definition of hate speech as discriminatory or pejorative language targeting individual or group identity factors, this tweet falls under the category of offensive content due to its use of language that is contemptuous and demeaning towards women. The target audience is explicitly identified as women, indicating a clear intent to insult or degrade based on gender. While it does not necessarily promote discrimination based on protected characteristics like religion, ethnicity, or race, its pejorative nature and direct targeting of women with derogatory language justify its classification as offensive rather than neutral or simply hate speech, which might imply a broader or more complex form of discriminatory intent.

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""nigger""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. The use of this term in the context provided is derogatory and contributes to a hostile and discriminatory tone. Additionally, the phrase ""sick of that nigger"" expresses a strong negative sentiment towards an individual or group based on their race, which further solidifies its classification as hate speech.

The mention of ""R Kelly"" in the tweet could imply a reference to the American singer R. Kelly, who has been involved in several controversies and legal issues. However, the context in which his name is used (""get R Kelly the fidduck out of here"") does not alter the hateful nature of the statement due to the subsequent use of the racial slur.

The key features identified (""sick"", ""of"", ""that"", ""nigger"") highlight the parts of the sentence that contribute most to its classification as hate speech, with ""nigger"" being the most egregious term. The target of this hate speech is African individuals, as indicated by the racial slur used.

Overall, the tweet's language and tone are discriminatory, hostile, and demeaning towards Black people, which categorizes it unequivocally as hate speech.",105.35

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet

Despite the absence of key features, the context of the tweet implies that it is intended to be a provocative or attention-grabbing statement, potentially aiming to attract clicks or views. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the tweet does not contain hate speech or discriminatory language targeting any specific group based on identity factors such as religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, or other characteristics. The label ""normal"" seems appropriate in this case, as the tweet, although explicit and potentially offensive to some due to its adult nature, does not convey biased, bigoted, or intolerant messages towards an individual or group.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Conclusion: This text is classified as normal because it lacks explicit hate speech or offensive language directed at a specific target, despite containing suggestive terms that could be associated with adult content; the absence of identified key features and a targeted group, combined with the seeming promotional tone, supports its classification as non-offensive within the given context.",96.54

Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:
This statement is labeled offensive because it uses derogatory language and stereotypes to insult and demean individuals or groups.

The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.

By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality.

The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

Step 2: Analyzing the tweet text itself, there are no explicit key features that can be identified as derogatory towards women or any specific group. However, the statement ""all women are actresses"" could be perceived as a trivialization of women's roles and experiences, reducing them to their professional appearances.

Step 3: Although the target is not explicitly stated in this tweet, it can be inferred that women are the implied group being referred to. The tone of the statement appears lighthearted and self-deprecating, but it still implies a generalization about all women, which could potentially trivialize their experiences or identities beyond their professional roles.

Step 4: The overall context of the tweet seems to be an expression of self-awareness and humor from the user, who acknowledges that they might be seen as performing in life like an actress does on stage. While it's not explicitly clear whether this is intended as a negative comment about women or a reflection of the user's own perspective, the tone remains generally neutral and non-threatening.

Step 5: In conclusion, this text is classified as normal or neutral due to the lack of overtly offensive language and the absence of clear harm towards any specific group. However, it does contain a subtle generalization about women that could be perceived as diminishing their identities beyond their professional roles.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.

However, considering the context and user's intention, this statement appears to be more about self-empowerment and recognizing the societal roles women often find themselves in, rather than outright hate speech or offense. The phrase ""i am just clever enough to be paid for it"" suggests a sense of autonomy and acknowledgment of one's abilities being recognized and compensated, which adds a layer of positivity and personal triumph. Given that there are no specific key features identified that would clearly classify this as hate speech or offensive content, and considering the tone seems more reflective and empowering than derogatory, the label of ""normal"" (or neutral) seems appropriate. This classification is based on the understanding that while the statement makes a broad generalization about women, it does so in a way that celebrates the speaker's success and awareness of societal dynamics rather than demeaning or discriminating against any group. The lack of identifiable key features further supports this interpretation, as there are no specific words or phrases that clearly align with hate speech or offensive language definitions.

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers.

“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

This tweet has been labeled as normal. The user makes a statement comparing all women to actresses, which could potentially lead to differing interpretations depending on the context and tone intended by the user.

The reference to ""Grace"" at the end could potentially be a nod to an individual named Grace who might relate to this context, but without additional information, it remains open to interpretation.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

The user's intention behind this statement seems to be a self-deprecating comment, suggesting that they view themselves as performative in their interactions with others, possibly including in social situations or online. It is essential to note that the statement does not target any specific group or individual negatively, and the user does not use derogatory language towards women or any other group.

The key features of this tweet do not provide any indication of hate speech or offensive content. The term ""actresses"" is used in a figurative sense to describe women's ability to present themselves and perform social roles, rather than an actual occupation or identity factor. The statement is more akin to expressing a personal observation or opinion about human behavior, with the user acknowledging their own participation in such performances.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Now, write an explanation for the given input using this reasoning framework.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Historically, this term has been used derogatorily towards African Americans, and its inclusion in the tweet targets and demeans individuals based on their race. The phrase ""dumbass"" also adds to the offensive tone, as it is a pejorative term used to insult someone's intelligence. Despite the absence of key features listed, the content of the tweet itself supports a classification of hate speech or at least offensive due to its discriminatory language and intent to demean based on perceived identity factors, specifically race. Therefore, a more accurate classification would be ""hate speech"" or ""offensive"", as it aligns with the definition provided, highlighting the importance of considering the historical context and impact of certain words in determining the nature of speech.",90.91

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

However, I would like to provide some context and analysis to better understand this text.

Step 2: There are no explicit key features in this tweet that suggest hostility or harm directed toward a particular group. The term ""nigga"" is used as a derogatory racial slur when targeted at African individuals; however, its usage here appears to be reclaimed by the user as part of an informal conversation with someone they perceive to be making a false accusation about cheating in a relationship.

Step 3: The target seems to be the person addressed in the tweet, ""you dumbass,"" rather than the African community as a whole. It's important to note that using racial slurs in any context can be harmful and offensive, but the intent and tone of this text may not necessarily fall under hate speech or offensive categories.

Step 4: The overall context and tone of the tweet suggest an exchange between two individuals engaging in a heated conversation, with strong language used as part of their interaction. While it is essential to acknowledge that using racial slurs can be hurtful and offensive, the intention here might not have been to target or harm a specific group but rather to respond to an accusation made against them.

Step 5: In conclusion, this text can be considered neutral based on the provided information. However, it is essential to recognize that using derogatory language, regardless of the context and intent, can still contribute to perpetuating harmful stereotypes and causing unnecessary harm or distress, especially when aimed at marginalized communities. It's always crucial to use respectful and inclusive language in our interactions with others.",21.12

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual.

“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.

By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet has been labeled normal by the dataset, but upon analysis, it contains elements that could be considered offensive or even hate speech. The use of the term ""nigga"" is a racial slur that is historically and culturally offensive towards African Americans. Additionally, the language used (""dumbass"") is derogatory and insulting.

However, considering the context in which the word ""nigga"" is used, it might be interpreted as a form of reclaimed language or a term used within certain communities. The primary focus of the message appears to be condemning cheating behavior rather than targeting a specific racial group. The insult (""dumbass nigga"") seems to be directed at an individual's actions (cheating) rather than their race.

Despite this, the use of such language can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to a hostile environment, even if not explicitly intended as hate speech. The term ""nigga"" carries significant historical and social baggage, making its use potentially offensive regardless of context. Therefore, while the intent might be to criticize behavior rather than race, the choice of words could still be seen as problematic and not entirely ""normal"" in a broader societal context that values respectful dialogue.",100.27

The tweet has been labeled as 'normal', but this classification might be questionable. The use of a racial slur (""nigga"") and an insult (""dumbass"") could be perceived as offensive by some definitions or standards. However, in certain contexts, particularly within communities where such terms have undergone reclamation, the term ""nigga"" might not always be interpreted as hate speech but rather as part of everyday language use among friends or peers who share a common understanding and do not intend harm or degradation. The context is crucial; if used between consenting individuals in an intimate setting without malice, it may not be considered hate speech. However, outside of these contexts, the term can be highly offensive. It's important to note that this classification reflects a nuanced interpretation where intent and relationship dynamics play significant roles. Without further information about the sender's identity or their relationship with the recipient, a definitive judgment on whether this constitutes hate speech is challenging.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.

Although the term ""nigga"" is historically derogatory towards African Americans, in this instance it appears to be used as a form of insult or epithet towards an individual, rather than as a means of promoting negative stereotypes or discrimination against an entire racial group. The use of the word ""dumbass"" further emphasizes that the tweet is targeted at the specific individual being addressed and not at the African American community as a whole.

Moreover, the phrase ""grow up"" in the tweet suggests a tone of frustration and impatience with the addressee's actions or behavior, rather than an expression of hatred or bigotry. The lack of key features in this tweet that directly reference or target specific identity factors beyond the African American context further supports the classification as offensive rather than hate speech. However, it is important to note that even offensive language can still be harmful and hurtful, and efforts should always be made to use respectful and inclusive language towards all individuals.

In summary, this tweet falls into the offensive category because it contains language that is intended to insult or demean an individual, rather than promoting discrimination or negative stereotypes against a specific group based on their identity factors. The user's intent appears to be to express frustration or impatience with the addressee's actions, rather than to spread hatred or intolerance towards African Americans as a whole. While offensive language is still harmful and should be avoided, it is important to understand the nuances of context and intent behind such expressions in order to effectively address and respond to them.",20.85

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet contains multiple hateful and derogatory terms, including ""nigger"" and ""Jews."" The statement ""fuck that nigger"" is a clear expression of racism against African people. The mention of the ""National African American Communist Party"" and accusing it of being ""founded and run by Jews"" is an anti-Semitic statement. This statement not only promotes racial hatred but also religious discrimination, making it hate speech that targets both the African and Jewish communities.

Another key feature in this tweet is the use of the term ""altright."" Alt-Right is a loosely defined political label for far-right ideologies that incorporates elements from white nationalism, white supremacist groups, and anti-immigration sentiments, among others. This ideology often includes hate speech, discrimination, and intolerance towards various marginalized communities, making it an offensive and discriminatory term. The mention of this term in the tweet adds to its overall hateful nature.",19.56

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against specific groups. In this case, the targeted groups are African and Jewish people.

Step 2: Key features like ""fuck that nigger"" and ""nigger"" are explicitly racist and dehumanizing, expressing a clear intent to harm the African community. ""Look up it history that's not j.p. sedita saying that its ok to be white"" implies justification for hate speech against African people and uses the racial slur multiple times. The phrase ""altright american nationalist"" further indicates an association with white supremacist ideology, which is a form of hate speech targeting marginalized groups.

Step 3: The targets are explicitly mentioned as African and Jewish people, making this statement particularly harmful to these communities.

Step 4: The context and tone express hostility, hate, and intolerance towards the targeted groups, aiming to demean and exclude them. The use of racial slurs and derogatory language serves no purpose but to incite harm and perpetuate prejudice.

Conclusion: This text is hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm against specific groups, as well as its derogatory language and intolerant tone towards African and Jewish people. The use of racial slurs and the association with white supremacist ideology further emphasize the harmful nature of this statement.",20.89

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals. 
","{'post_id': '14549463_gab', 'tweet_text': 'i love your pro white jack o lantern fuck that nigger and fuck the national african american communist party founded and run by jews look up it history that not j.p. sedita saying that its ok to be white altright american nationalist', 'key_features': ['fuck', 'that', 'nigger', 'jews'], 'target': 'African, Jewish', 'label': 'hatespeech'}","**Explanation:**

This statement is classified as hate speech due to the presence of several key features that promote hatred, intolerance, and discrimination towards specific racial and ethnic groups. 

1. **Use of Racial Slurs:** The tweet contains the racial slur ""nigger,"" which is a highly offensive term used to demean and dehumanize Black individuals. This word has a long history of being used in a derogatory manner and contributes significantly to the hateful tone of the statement.

2. **Anti-Semitic References:** The mention of ""jews"" in the context of founding and running the National African American Communist Party is made with an apparent intent to spread conspiracy theories that have been historically used to vilify Jewish people. This perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jewish control over other ethnic groups, which is a common trope in anti-Semitic rhetoric.

3. **Promotion of White Supremacy:** The phrase ""it's ok to be white"" and the hashtags ""#altright #american nationalist"" are associated with movements that promote white supremacy and nationalism. These ideologies often involve the belief in the superiority of white people over others, which is fundamentally racist and discriminatory.

4. **Historical Misrepresentation and Conspiracy Theories:** The reference to looking up the history of the National African American Communist Party ""founded and run by jews"" suggests a propagation of conspiracy theories that are not based on factual history but rather serve to fuel hatred and misconceptions about Jewish people and their alleged influence over Black political movements.

5. **Direct Threats and Insults:** The use of ""fuck that nigger"" is a direct insult aimed at demeaning and dehumanizing an individual or group based on race, which is a clear indicator of hate speech. Additionally, the language used against Jewish individuals by implying they are behind certain political movements with malicious intent further amplifies the hateful content.

Given these features, the statement clearly falls under the category of hate speech as it aims to incite hatred and violence against specific groups based on their race, ethnicity, or perceived religious affiliations. It uses derogatory language, promotes conspiracy theories, and aligns itself with ideologies that advocate for the supremacy of one racial group over others.",176.67

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

The author finds it ""purest"" that these men, who may have lacked certain experiences or possessions growing up, can still show emotion in response to small things. This statement is neutral as it does not contain discriminatory or pejorative language towards Hispanic immigrants or any other group.

The context of the tweet suggests a positive sentiment towards Hispanic immigrant fathers and an acknowledgment of their strength and resilience, which contradicts hate speech definitions. The user's intention seems to be sharing an observation and expressing admiration rather than intending to demean or discriminate against any group.

The key features of the tweet do not contribute to the classification as they are absent from this particular tweet.

- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.

- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.

   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual.

“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals.

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet has been labeled normal because it shares a positive observation about Hispanic immigrant fathers, highlighting their emotional side and the innocence of finding joy in small things they couldn't have as children. There is no derogatory language or negative sentiment expressed against any individual or group based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, etc., making it non-offensive and not hate speech.

The user seems to appreciate the cultural nuances and personal growth that these fathers experience upon immigration, which could contribute positively to family dynamics by enriching emotional expression. The use of words like ""wholesome"" and ""purest thing"" further emphasize the positive sentiment being conveyed, contributing to a narrative that celebrates human experiences across different cultures.

Given this context, it's evident why such content would be classified as normal since it promotes understanding and appreciation without inciting any form of hate or discrimination. This type of post fosters inclusivity by acknowledging shared human experiences despite cultural differences. It also challenges stereotypes about immigrant families' emotional restraint by showcasing their vulnerability and capacity for joy in simple pleasures. The tweet encourages viewers to recognize the universal aspects of parenting across cultures, focusing on common ground instead of division.",133.37

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

First, it is crucial to note that the term ""nigga"" is historically offensive and derogatory towards African people. However, in some contemporary hip hop and urban culture contexts, this term can be used among friends or acquaintances of similar background as a term of endearment or familiarity.

In this case, considering the absence of any other hateful or discriminatory language in the tweet, the user's intention might not have been to demean or attack someone based on their race. Instead, it appears that the text is an expression of anger and frustration towards a specific person, likely within a group or social context where the use of this term may be more acceptable.

Additionally, the phrases ""when u become my bitch boy"" and ""what 💔"" suggest a personal conflict or argument rather than a broader attempt to demean or harass an entire racial or ethnic group.

Therefore, while the use of the term ""nigga"" can be considered offensive and potentially problematic due to its historical context, the overall content of this tweet seems more focused on a specific personal interaction and is not clearly hate speech or discriminatory towards African people.

- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.

3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group

   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

Step 2: Despite the absence of explicitly listed key features, phrases like ""nigga"" and ""bitch boy"" can be perceived as derogatory or offensive in many contexts.  
Step 3: The target is listed as ""African, None"", indicating a potential racial component, but the term ""nigga"" is used here in a manner that could be interpreted as informal or colloquial within certain social circles, rather than strictly as a racial slur.  
Step 4: The context and tone of the message appear to be confrontational or aggressive, with language that is sexually explicit and dominating (""my bitch boy""), yet the classification as ""normal"" implies an interpretation where this language is seen as part of an exchange that does not cross into hate speech or severe offensiveness.

This indicates that the text does not contain any hate speech or offensive language that could directly harm or incite violence against a specific group.

Step 2: There are no explicit key features present in the text to support a classification of hate speech or offense. The text contains colloquial and abbreviated language, such as ""nigga,"" ""hit me with the so,"" and ""what \ud83d\ude44."" These expressions are commonly used in informal conversations and do not necessarily reflect malicious intent on their own.

Step 3: The target is unclear, as the text does not explicitly refer to a specific group or individual. However, one could argue that the use of the racial slur ""nigga"" implies an intention towards a racial target. Given that the label is marked as neutral, it appears that this context is being evaluated with some leniency, potentially due to the informal and colloquial nature of the text.

Step 4: Examining the overall context and tone of the text reveals an exchange between individuals using informal language. The phrase ""when u become my bitch boy"" could be interpreted as a form of bravado or tough talk, rather than a genuine threat or expression of hate speech. Without further information about the conversation or the relationship between the speakers, it is difficult to definitively assess their intentions.

In conclusion, this text is classified as ""normal"" or neutral despite the presence of a racial slur because the context and tone appear to be informal and not inherently malicious or hateful. However, it is important to acknowledge that the use of such language can still be harmful and perpetuate negative stereotypes. Ultimately, context plays a significant role in determining the intent behind such language, and careful consideration should be given when evaluating potentially offensive content.",21.34

Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:

The statement is a factual report of events without any explicit derogatory, hateful, or harmful language targeting a specific individual or group based on characteristics like race, religion, or ethnicity. It lacks the intention to incite hate or violence, which is key to labeling content as hate speech.

Label -> Offensive
 
“pocahontas jumps in bed with moslem terrorists interesting combo”

Explanation:

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

3) ""pro tip the niggers do not care if you never owned slaves granddaddy fought the natzis or great great grandad ground the confederacy into dust with the boot heel of the proto bolshevik yankee gubment force of weight and arms behind it they hate you because you are white and you exist altright""

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

Explanation:
The tweet contains a racial slur (""nigga"") which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. The use of this term in this context appears derogatory and contributes to a hostile tone. Furthermore, the language used is aggressive and includes references to violence (""he hit me""), as well as demeaning and sexually suggestive phrases (""what u become my bitch boy""). This kind of language fosters a culture of disrespect, objectification, and potential violence, making it highly inappropriate.

The tweet's content does not align with what would be considered ""normal"" or acceptable speech in most contexts due to its use of hate speech and offensive language. A more accurate label for this tweet would likely be ""Hate Speech"" because it contains a racial slur and promotes a demeaning and hostile attitude towards an individual based on their race. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature, making the argument for it being classified as anything other than hate speech difficult to justify.",91.57

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.

Label -> Offensive

Explanation:
This statement is labeled offensive because it uses derogatory language and stereotypes to insult and demean individuals or groups.

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggers""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. The term is often associated with discrimination, violence, and marginalization of African Americans. Even without additional context, the use of this word in any sentence tends to convey hostility or disdain towards the group it targets.

In this specific case, the phrase ""you niggers blow my mind"" can be interpreted in several ways, but given the inclusion of the slur, it's reasonable to infer that the intent is derogatory. The phrase might be expressing astonishment or disbelief in a way that is demeaning or belittling towards African individuals, reinforcing negative stereotypes or perceptions.

The presence of ""you"" at the beginning of the sentence directly addresses and targets the group, making the language more personal and confrontational. This kind of direct address with a slur amplifies the offensive nature of the statement, contributing to its classification as hate speech. Overall, the use of derogatory language that targets a specific racial or ethnic group based on their identity is a hallmark of hate speech, aiming to demean, intimidate, or marginalize the targeted community.",97.93

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

The lack of key features provided limits deeper analysis, but the target audience being ""Homosexual, None"" implies the tweet is more about personal exploration or statement rather than targeting any specific group with hate speech or offense. The user's intention behind the tweet seems to be one of curiosity or declaration regarding their own identity, particularly in relation to their social circle (""all my bitches gay""), which does not inherently promote discrimination, bias, or intolerance against any individual or group based on identity factors such as sexual orientation.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 2: Although there are no specified key features, the use of the term 'bitches' and the self-reference to being potentially a 'dyke' could be seen as either reclaiming derogatory terms or using them in a manner that might be perceived as insensitive by some.
Step 3: The target is listed as both ""Homosexual"" and ""None"", indicating a potential ambiguity in how the text is directed, but it seems to involve self-identification with or questioning of one's sexual orientation in relation to the behaviors or preferences of others who are gay.
Step 4: The context appears to be one of personal introspection or self-questioning regarding sexual identity, rather than an intent to harm or offend. 
Conclusion: This text is classified as 'normal' because, despite using language that could be seen as provocative or inappropriate in some contexts, it lacks a clear intent to incite harm, violence, or hatred against any group, and instead seems to express personal confusion or self-inquiry about sexual orientation, which might be interpreted as a form of self-expression rather than an attack on others. The absence of key features explicitly listed may also indicate that the language, although potentially problematic, does not automatically classify the text as hate speech or offensive without considering the broader context of self-identification and personal expression.",114.97

The tweet is labeled as normal because it appears to be an expression of self-identification and questioning rather than an attack or derogatory statement towards any individual or group.

The language used is informal and includes slang terms like ""bitches,"" but in this context, it does not seem to carry a negative connotation towards the LGBTQ+ community. Instead, it reflects an attempt at self-identification or understanding within a social circle that identifies as gay. The absence of hate speech, derogatory language, or intent to harm or discriminate against any group based on their sexual orientation supports its classification as normal.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:

The user seems to be using these words to express a sense of camaraderie with the homosexual community, perhaps implying that they have many homosexual friends who behave in a certain way that makes the user feel connected to them.

The term ""bitches"" can be considered derogatory when used to demean women, but in this context, it appears to be used more as a term of endearment or familiarity for friends, regardless of their sexual orientation. The term ""dyke,"" which historically has been used as a pejorative term against lesbian women, may seem concerning at first glance, but given the context and the use of the term in conjunction with ""bitches"" and ""gay,"" it appears more likely that the user is attempting to express solidarity or acceptance of the homosexual community rather than using the term as a slur.

It is important to note that this interpretation relies on the context provided, which may not always be clear from just the text of the tweet alone.

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual.

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning.

The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.

   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]

   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None

Step 1: The label is classified as normal or neutral, which suggests the text does not contain offensive or harmful language toward a specific group. However, it's important to note that the term ""retarded"" can be considered derogatory and offensive when used in reference to intellectual disabilities. In this context, the intent and tone of the user are crucial in understanding its meaning.

Step 2: The key features do not provide any clear indication of hate speech or offensive language; however, the use of the term ""retarded"" could be considered insensitive when discussing intelligence.

Step 3: The target is not explicitly stated but could potentially include individuals with intellectual disabilities. However, based on the text alone, it does not appear that the user was intentionally referring to or attacking this group.

Step 4: Analyzing the context and tone, it seems more likely that the user was making a rhetorical question rather than expressing harm or hate toward anyone. The question is phrased as a general statement without any malicious intent or derogatory language directed at the target group.

Conclusion: While the term ""retarded"" has the potential to be offensive when used in certain contexts, the user's intent and tone do not appear to suggest harm or hate speech. As a result, despite the sensitivity of the term used, this text is classified as normal due to the absence of direct offensive language and lack of explicit targeting of a group.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:

By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist.""

The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

The tweet expresses a positive sentiment of affection towards one or more individuals, indicated by the repetition of ""<user>"" followed by ""i love you."" This expression does not contain any discriminatory, pejorative, or offensive language that targets or demeans an individual or group based on their identity factors such as religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, etc. The absence of key features that are typically indicative of hate speech or offensive content further supports this classification. The user's intent appears to be one of affection and positivity, with no apparent attempt to degrade, discriminate against, or promote negative stereotypes about any group. Therefore, given the tweet's context, content, and the lack of any identifiable discriminatory elements, it falls squarely into the neutral category, aligning with the provided label as a statement that does not contain hate speech or offensive content.",85.48

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 1: The label is normal or neutral, which signifies that the content does not contain offensive or harmful language.

Step 2: There are no key features in this text that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes. Instead, it consists of three user mentions and an expression of love.

Step 3: The target is ""None,"" as there is no clear group or individual being referenced or targeted in the statement.

Step 4: Analyzing the context and tone, this text appears to be a friendly interaction between users expressing their affection for one another. It lacks any derogatory language, stereotypes, or negative intentions towards others. The absence of hate speech, offensive language, and targeted groups justifies the normal label assigned to this text.

In conclusion, the text ""i love you"" is classified as normal or neutral due to its lack of harmful language, non-targeted nature, and friendly tone between users.

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual.

“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

The user's intention behind this statement appears to be playful banter, possibly inspired by online culture where ""beef"" refers to public debates or arguments between individuals on social media platforms. The absence of derogatory language or discriminatory targeting towards Caucasian or Christian individuals indicates that the tweet is not hate speech.

Although the term ""white Christian mom"" could be perceived as identifying a particular demographic, it does not contain any negative connotation or intent. In this context, there's no evidence of disdain or intolerance towards white Christian mothers, making it more likely to be considered normal rather than hate speech.

Additionally, the key features of the tweet do not support a classification of hate speech. The statement lacks pejorative language and does not directly attack or demean any individual or group based on their identity factors. Overall, this tweet represents a common social media expression with no discriminatory or intolerant undertones.",19.64

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.

At first glance, the mention of specific demographic characteristics (""white Christian mom"") might suggest targeting based on race and religion, potentially leaning towards hate speech. However, analyzing the tweet's context and user intention reveals that the focus is on initiating a Twitter argument (""twitter beef""), which is a common online phenomenon where users engage in light-hearted or humorous disputes. The lack of key features provided does not hinder this interpretation since the language used does not convey discriminatory, pejorative, or demeaning tones towards the mentioned group. Instead, it appears to be a casual and perhaps playful declaration of intent to engage in an online interaction that might be based on differing opinions or perspectives rather than hatred or intolerance. The target audience (""Caucasian, Christian, None"") is specified but in this context seems more about identifying a potential opponent for the Twitter beef rather than expressing hate towards these groups.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 1: The label is labeled as ""normal"" or neutral, indicating that the content does not contain hate speech or offensive language. However, this text seems to express a strong emotion and may warrant further analysis to ensure it remains within the neutral classification.

Step 2: There are no explicit key features in the text that indicate a call for violence or harm against a specific group. The statement ""i kinda just wanna kill all the mean people I encounter"" can be interpreted as an expression of frustration or anger towards individuals who exhibit malicious behavior rather than a targeted attack on any particular group.

Step 3: The target in this text appears to be generic, referring to ""mean people"" instead of a specific ethnicity, race, religion, or gender. It does not directly single out or vilify any particular group, and it's important to consider the difference between expressing anger towards individuals and expressing hatred towards groups.

Step 4: The context and tone should be analyzed for user intent. Based on this text alone, there is no clear evidence that the author intends to carry out violence against anyone or incites others to do so. The statement could simply reflect an emotional response to past encounters with unkind individuals, rather than a serious threat.

Step 5: Conclusion: While the text ""i kinda just wanna kill all the mean people I encounter"" may seem disturbing at first glance, its context and tone suggest that it is likely an expression of frustration or anger towards malicious behavior rather than a call to harm or incite violence against individuals or groups. The label remains neutral as there's no evident intent to incite harm or target any particular group. However, it's important to remember that context plays a significant role in determining the true nature and intent behind such statements.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet

The context of this tweet suggests that the user is expressing frustration and possibly anger towards individuals they perceive as mean, with their intention being to vent about their emotional state rather than directly threatening violence. However, the presence of the phrase ""kill all the mean people"" introduces a violent element that could be interpreted as hateful or offensive, especially if taken literally. The absence of specific key features identified in the tweet makes it challenging to pinpoint a particular group or individual being targeted, which might explain its classification as ""normal"". Nonetheless, considering the definition of hate speech, this statement could be seen as promoting violence against a perceived group (mean people), which aligns more closely with offensive content due to its pejorative and potentially discriminatory tone. The tweet's content supports this interpretation because it calls out for harm towards an undefined but broad category of people based on their behavior, suggesting a form of intolerance.

Your Job is to analyze the tweet and write **Explaination** on it by taking inspiration from the examples bellow. 
Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:

The statement is a factual report of events without any explicit derogatory, hateful, or harmful language targeting a specific individual or group based on characteristics like race, religion, or ethnicity. It lacks the intention to incite hate or violence, which is key to labeling content as hate speech.

Label -> Offensive
 
“pocahontas jumps in bed with moslem terrorists interesting combo”

Explanation:
This statement is labeled offensive because it uses derogatory language and stereotypes to insult and demean individuals or groups. Referring to someone as ""Pocahontas"" in a pejorative context is disrespectful, and associating them with ""Muslim terrorists"" perpetuates harmful stereotypes and biases, making the comment offensive and inappropriate.

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

3) ""pro tip the niggers do not care if you never owned slaves granddaddy fought the natzis or great great grandad ground the confederacy into dust with the boot heel of the proto bolshevik yankee gubment force of weight and arms behind it they hate you because you are white and you exist altright""

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet has been labeled as ""normal"" because, despite expressing a violent sentiment (""kill all the mean people""), it appears to be an emotional and hyperbolic statement rather than a genuine call to action or a direct threat. The language used is more indicative of frustration and exasperation with encountering mean individuals rather than promoting or advocating for violence against any specific group based on characteristics like race, religion, ethnicity, etc. It can be interpreted as a figure of speech or an expression of personal feeling rather than an intent to harm. However, the context in which this statement is made could potentially influence its interpretation, and it might be seen differently depending on cultural, social, or personal perspectives on expressions of violence.",61.12

The intention behind this statement seems to be provocative and divisive, aiming to stir controversy by questioning Obama's racial background and suggesting that his mixed heritage was ignored or undervalued. The reference to ""Barry treated like the lion king"" could be seen as demeaning or reducing, implying that Obama's presidency or character was overly glorified in a simplistic manner.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

The tweet has been labeled as normal, but it contains elements that could be considered borderline or even offensive by some standards. The user questions former President Obama's blackness, stating he was a ""mulatto"" because his mother was white. This statement might be seen as an attempt to diminish Obama's African American identity or spark controversy around racial definitions.

The mention of ""racism against Caucasians"" and the claim that Obama's mother was ""thrown to the side"" suggests a narrative where the user feels there is an imbalance in how different races are treated or recognized, particularly criticizing what they perceive as preferential treatment towards Obama due to his partial African American heritage. The comparison of Obama being treated like ""the Lion King"" could be interpreted as either a neutral observation about his popularity or a derogatory remark implying that he was unfairly revered.

The inclusion of ""moral compass"" and the reference to ""Jimmy Swaggart special edition compass"" seems out of place but might indicate the user's attempt to question moral standards or hypocrisy, possibly in relation to how Obama or his race is perceived. The use of emojis (🐒 🐒 🐒) at the end could be seen as an attempt to soften the tone of the message or to express irony/sarcasm.

However, the core issue with labeling this tweet as simply ""normal"" lies in its potential to perpetuate racial stereotypes and ignite debates around mixed heritage identities. It touches on sensitive topics such as racial identity, perceived racism against different groups, and the complexities of multiculturalism without necessarily promoting hate or direct harm but does contain language that might be offensive or divisive to some readers. The context in which these statements are made and how they contribute to broader discussions about race and identity is crucial for understanding their impact.",144.62

The tweet has been labeled as ""normal"" because, despite its provocative and potentially controversial statement, it seems to express a personal observation rather than promoting hate or violence. The user criticizes the idea that feminism has led women to reject traditional roles like being a housewife but does so in a context that highlights an apparent contradiction within certain communities (specifically, referencing ""dykes"" who aspire to a domestic, farm-based life with their partners). 

The use of the term ""dykes"" might be seen as derogatory by some standards, but in this context, it appears to be used in a more neutral or possibly even positive manner, given the tone of the rest of the statement. The tweet does not contain explicit hate speech or direct attacks on any group based on their sexual orientation, gender, or other protected characteristics. 

However, one could argue that the tweet simplifies complex issues related to feminism and personal choices regarding lifestyle and career. It also generalizes about a specific subgroup within the LGBTQ+ community, which might be seen as reductionist. Nonetheless, given its overall tone and lack of explicit derogatory language aimed at inciting hatred or violence, it's classified as ""normal"" rather than hate speech or offensive content. 

It's worth noting that interpretations can vary widely depending on cultural context, personal experiences, and individual sensitivities to language. Some readers might find the tweet insensitive or dismissive of feminist ideals, while others might see it as a lighthearted observation about personal aspirations within certain communities.",125.26

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 2: There are no clear key features in this text that can be directly linked to hate speech or offense. However, it's important to note that this text contains some problematic statements and assumptions.

Step 3: The target of the text includes homosexual women and none specifically identified as hating being housewives. While a portion of this group is mentioned in the context, there is no intention to harm or degrade them. It's crucial to differentiate between criticizing an idea (feminism corrupting women) and directly attacking individuals or groups based on their identities.

Step 4: The overall context of the text appears to be more about expressing surprise and observation rather than making a harmful statement. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the assumption that all homosexual women cannot stop talking about living on a farm with their girlfriend implies a stereotype, which might not be harmful but could be seen as offensive by some.

Step 5: In conclusion, while this text contains problematic statements and assumptions, it does not meet the criteria for hate speech or offense due to its lack of explicit targeting and harm towards a specific group. The classification of ""normal"" suggests that the content is neutral and non-controversial overall. However, it's important to recognize that perpetuating stereotypes, even unintentionally, can still have negative consequences and should be addressed with care and consideration.",20.84

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:

The context suggests the user is critiquing what they perceive as a hypocrisy or oversight within certain feminist discourses that may overlook or dismiss the desires of some women to embrace traditionally domestic lifestyles. The user's intention seems to be observational and slightly critical rather than hateful or offensive, as they're highlighting a personal observation about the lesbian community they interact with. Despite the tweet touching on sensitive topics such as feminism and sexual orientation, it does not contain discriminatory language or pejorative content aimed at demeaning any group based on their identity factors like religion, ethnicity, gender, etc. The absence of key features listed may indicate that no overtly offensive words or phrases were detected, supporting the classification of the tweet as ""normal"" or neutral, as it presents a personal viewpoint without resorting to hate speech or offensive content. The target audience includes homosexuals and women, groups that are often subject to discrimination, but the tone of the tweet is more reflective and less confrontational, suggesting an attempt at commentary rather than an intent to harm or degrade. Overall, the classification as ""normal"" suggests that while the tweet engages with potentially controversial topics, it does so in a manner that is more discussive than divisive, lacking the characteristics that would define it as hate speech or overtly offensive content.",118.55

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

The text does not contain any overtly hateful or offensive language towards specific groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.

The key features identified in this tweet are ""feminism,"" ""women,"" ""dykes,"" and ""housewife.""

In conclusion, this tweet is a commentary on feminism and its perceived impact on certain women within the lesbian community, expressed in a non-hateful or offensive manner. The use of sensitive words like ""feminism,"" ""women,"" and ""dykes"" does not automatically equate to hate speech.

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.

   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.

The targets of this text are women and the homosexual community, but rather than being derogatory or offensive, the tone seems to be observational and somewhat playful.

Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment.

Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

This tweet has been labeled normal, but it contains elements that could be interpreted as promoting a negative and exclusionary view towards Muslims in India. The user questions why Muslims would seek refuge in India, suggesting that they should instead go to Islamic states like Bangladesh or Pakistan. This implies that India is not a suitable or safe place for Muslims, which could be seen as perpetuating a harmful stereotype.

The statement ""they should leave for their country asap for their safety"" is particularly concerning, as it implies that Muslims are not welcome in India and that their presence is somehow a threat to their own safety. This kind of language can contribute to an atmosphere of intolerance and hostility towards religious minorities.

However, the label ""normal"" suggests that the tone of the tweet may be seen as more inquiring or questioning rather than overtly aggressive or hateful. The user may be expressing a genuine (though misguided) concern for the safety of Muslims, rather than actively seeking to promote harm or discrimination against them.

It's worth noting that the context and intent behind the tweet are crucial in determining its true nature. If the tweet is part of a larger conversation or pattern of behavior that promotes intolerance or hatred towards Muslims, it could be reevaluated as hate speech.

   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

Step 2: Although there are no explicitly listed key features, phrases such as ""why will muslim take refugee in india"", ""isnt india supposed to be unsafe for muslims"", and ""they should leave for their country asap"" imply a discussion about the perceived safety and appropriateness of Muslims seeking refuge in India, given the existence of Islamic states like Bangladesh and Pakistan. These phrases could be seen as sparking debate or inquiry rather than outright hate. Step 3: The target appears to be ""None"", but the content of the message does refer to Muslims and their potential decision-making regarding refugee status in India versus other Islamic countries, indicating a discussion that involves a specific religious group. Step 4: The context and tone seem to question the logic of Muslims seeking refuge in India, suggesting an undercurrent of skepticism or misunderstanding about the reasons behind such decisions, rather than an explicit intent to harm or offend. Conclusion: This text is classified as 'normal' because, despite touching on sensitive topics and potentially perpetuating misconceptions about safety and religious affinity, it lacks direct incitement of violence, hate, or offensive language that would categorize it as hate speech or overtly offensive; the discussion, while potentially controversial, seems to stem from a place of inquiry or skepticism rather than malice.",117.14

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet is labeled as offensive due to its highly derogatory and inflammatory language. The use of explicit profanity (""fuck"") repeatedly throughout the message sets a hostile tone.

The phrase ""yo gay ass"" further emphasizes the derogatory intent by directly addressing or referring to someone in a demeaning manner based on perceived or actual sexual orientation.

The mention of ""fairy"" and ""faggot"" are particularly harmful as they are well-known homophobic slurs that have been used historically to belittle, demean, and discriminate against homosexual individuals. These words contribute to a culture of hate and intolerance, making the tweet not just offensive but also hurtful and discriminatory towards the LGBTQ+ community.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.

Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains derogatory language and harmful stereotypes.

Step 2: Key features like ""gay,"" ""ass,"" ""fairy,"" and ""faggot"" are used as insults and slurs targeting people with non-heterosexual identities. The frequent use of the word ""fuck"" intensifies the offensive nature of the text.

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

The tweet has been labeled normal, which may seem counterintuitive given the content. The user advocates for using specific search engines (Duck Duck Go) and browsers (Brave, Firefox, or Tor) due to their privacy policies and lack of tracking. However, the reason provided for this preference includes derogatory language targeting a group based on sexual orientation (""globalist queers""). This kind of language is typically considered offensive because it uses a slur against homosexual individuals, associating them with negative concepts like ""globalism"" in a pejorative manner.

Despite the use of offensive terminology, the primary message of the tweet focuses on promoting privacy and criticizing what the user perceives as ""globalism"" and the practices of Silicon Valley. The tweet does not directly incite violence or hatred against any group but uses derogatory language to express dissatisfaction with certain ideologies or corporate behaviors. 

The label of ""normal"" might be due to the tweet's overall theme of advocating for privacy and criticizing corporate or ideological entities, rather than a direct, personal attack on individuals based on their sexual orientation. However, the inclusion of derogatory terms makes the classification somewhat contentious, as such language contributes to a hostile environment for the targeted group. 

In a nuanced analysis, while the tweet's core message about privacy and boycotting certain corporations might be seen as political or ideological rather than purely hateful, the use of slurs complicates this interpretation. The balance between political expression and hate speech can be delicate, and different evaluators might categorize this tweet differently based on their criteria for what constitutes hate speech versus offensive language within a political or social critique context.",133.44

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Now, write an explanation for the given input using this reasoning framework.

Step 1: The classification as ""normal"" suggests the text, while possibly sarcastic or dismissive, does not cross into hate speech or overtly offensive territory. Step 2: Despite there being no explicitly listed key features, phrases like ""literally no one cares"" and ""oh look we got a white person to complain about this"" convey a tone of sarcasm and dismissal, potentially critiquing the act of complaining rather than targeting an individual or group with hate. Step 3: The target is listed as ""None"", which supports the notion that the text does not directly attack or demean any specific group or individual, even though it critiques the action of a ""white person"" complaining, it's more about the act than the person's race. Step 4: Examining the context and tone reveals a sarcastic intent to belittle the significance of someone's complaint, possibly suggesting hypocrisy or lack of concern from others, but without expressing direct hostility or incitement of harm. Conclusion: This text is classified as ""normal"" because, despite its sarcastic and somewhat critical nature, it lacks explicit hate speech or offensive language directed at a specific group or individual, focusing instead on the critique of an action in a manner that, while dismissive, does not escalate to harmful or offensive levels.",117.42

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

The context suggests that the user is expressing frustration or dismissiveness towards the perceived complainer, rather than intending to degrade or discriminate against white people as a group.

The tweet does not contain any hate speech or offensive language, as it does not target or disparage individuals or groups based on their identity factors. The absence of key features that are commonly associated with hate speech, such as derogatory slurs or prejudiced statements, further supports the neutral classification.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.

- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men

   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.

Your Job is to analyze the tweet and write **Explaination** on it by taking inspiration from the examples bellow. 
Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:

The statement is a factual report of events without any explicit derogatory, hateful, or harmful language targeting a specific individual or group based on characteristics like race, religion, or ethnicity. It lacks the intention to incite hate or violence, which is key to labeling content as hate speech.

Label -> Offensive
 
“pocahontas jumps in bed with moslem terrorists interesting combo”

Explanation:
This statement is labeled offensive because it uses derogatory language and stereotypes to insult and demean individuals or groups. Referring to someone as ""Pocahontas"" in a pejorative context is disrespectful, and associating them with ""Muslim terrorists"" perpetuates harmful stereotypes and biases, making the comment offensive and inappropriate.

Such language fosters prejudice, discrimination, and hostility toward immigrants. Furthermore it incitement to

 
Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

3) ""pro tip the niggers do not care if you never owned slaves granddaddy fought the natzis or great great grandad ground the confederacy into dust with the boot heel of the proto bolshevik yankee gubment force of weight and arms behind it they hate you because you are white and you exist altright""

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet has been labeled as ""normal"" because, despite the mention of a serious and sensitive topic like rape, the context in which it is used appears to be metaphorical or fantastical. The claim of being raped by an alien is implausible and likely intended to be humorous or attention-grabbing rather than a genuine report of sexual assault.

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

The tweet has been labeled as normal because, despite containing a derogatory term (""backwoods redneck""), the context suggests it is being used to describe a specific group's perceived lack of awareness about sports rather than to incite hate or violence. The term ""redneck"" can be offensive, but in this instance, it seems to be used more to criticize a perceived provincialism or ignorance about sports outside of Oklahoma, rather than targeting a racial, ethnic, or religious group directly. However, the use of such language can still perpetuate stereotypes and contribute to a divisive tone, even if not explicitly hateful. The mention of ""Oklahoma"" and the description of a segment of society there as unaware of other sports might imply a form of regional stereotyping but does not rise to the level of hate speech as defined by direct threats, incitement to violence, or severe and pervasive harassment based on protected characteristics.",78.3

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.

There is no hate speech or offensive content present in this tweet.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 1: The label is classified as ""normal"" or neutral, which indicates the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.

Step 2: There are no specific key features in this text that can be directly linked to hate speech or stereotyping. Instead, it contains mentions of various users and the location ""Oklahoma.""

Step 3: The target group is ambiguous in this text. While there's a mention of ""the backwoods redneck portion of society,"" it does not specifically refer to women but rather seems to be referring to a particular group of people with specific cultural characteristics. However, the text does not make any derogatory or harmful statements about women.

Step 4: The overall context and tone appear to be light-hearted and informal, with no apparent intention to harm or offend anyone. The users seem to be discussing societal differences and expressing their own opinions, which is a common occurrence on social media platforms.

Conclusion: This text can be considered neutral as it lacks offensive language, harmful stereotypes, and does not directly target any specific group or individual. Even though there's a mention of ""backwoods rednecks,"" the text itself doesn't contain derogatory or hateful content towards this group or women. The context and tone are more likely to be seen as playful banter among friends rather than an expression of hatred or intolerance.",21.03

However, upon closer examination, it appears that the label might be misleading, as the tweet text expresses a derogatory sentiment towards a specific group of people in Oklahoma, referring to them as ""backwoods redneck"". Despite the absence of key features explicitly listed, the phrase ""backwoods redneck"" can be considered a crucial element in understanding the tone and intent of the message. The target of this statement seems to be a subset of society in Oklahoma, perceived as being uninformed about sports other than potentially American football or others popular in the region. The context and tone of the message come across as dismissive and demeaning towards this group, implying a lack of sophistication or culture. Considering the overall intent and language used, it could be argued that the text leans more towards being offensive due to its use of pejorative terms to describe a particular segment of society. Nevertheless, the classification as ""normal"" might stem from the tweet's informal and conversational nature, lacking explicit hate speech or direct calls for harm. Ultimately, the reasoning behind the ""normal"" label may hinge on the nuances of interpretation, where the language, although derogatory, is not deemed severe enough to warrant an ""offensive"" classification, highlighting the complexities in discerning between offensive content and merely derogatory speech in social media contexts.",113.54

The statement ""lil white ass never wants to go home"" is labeled as normal because it appears to be a simple observation or expression of frustration.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

However, the use of ""white ass"" might be seen as mildly derogatory by some standards due to its informal and potentially diminutive tone, but in this context, it does not seem to incite hate or violence towards any group based on their race or ethnicity. The lack of key features or additional information that would typically accompany hate speech or offensive language further supports the classification as normal.",73.66

Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

This statement is labeled as offensive because it contains highly derogatory and racist language. The use of the term ""nigger"" is a racial slur that is deeply offensive and dehumanizing towards African people. Furthermore, the context in which this word is used, combined with explicit and violent imagery (""get fisted""), amplifies the offensive nature of the statement. The statement's intent appears to be provocative and hateful, aiming to shock or offend rather than communicate a legitimate idea or sentiment. This kind of language contributes to a hostile environment and perpetuates racism and discrimination against African individuals. 

Note: The term used is considered extremely offensive and its use in any context is generally viewed as hate speech due to its historical and ongoing association with racial violence, oppression, and discrimination.",66.89

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains derogatory language that could harm or degrade individuals based on their race.

Step 2: Key feature ""nigger"" is a racial slur and a highly offensive term used to demean African people. It is not part of an inclusive or respectful dialogue.

Step 3: The target in this text is the African community, which is explicitly referenced with a racial slur, making it a derogatory and harmful statement towards them.

Step 4: The overall context and tone are not justifying or explaining why the speaker would prefer such an experience – they are simply expressing a preference that involves dehumanizing language and racist imagery. The user's intent seems to be to offend and degrade members of the African community.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 2: Although there are no explicitly identified key features, phrases like ""i fucking hate you"" could initially suggest hostility; however, in the context of social media and considering the use of ""\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02"" (which represents a face with tears of joy), this expression is more likely being used in an exaggerated or joking manner rather than literal hatred. Step 3: The target is listed as ""None"", which aligns with the interpretation that the statement, despite its strong language, does not specifically aim to harm or offend a particular group or individual. Step 4: Examining the overall context and tone, the inclusion of emojis like ""\ud83d\ude02"" (face with tears of joy) significantly alters the perceived intent, suggesting the user is expressing mock anger or frustration in a lighthearted way rather than genuine malice. Conclusion: This text is classified as normal because, despite containing strong language, the context provided by the emojis and the lack of a targeted group suggest the user's intent is not to cause harm or offense but rather to express themselves in an informal, joking manner typical of social media interactions.",109.71

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

However, analyzing the context and user's intention reveals that the tone is likely playful or exaggerated rather than genuinely hateful. The use of the phrase ""i am dead"" followed by multiple laughing face emojis (\ud83d\ude02) indicates a lighthearted or joking demeanor, suggesting that the ""hate"" expressed is not meant to be taken seriously. The lack of specific key features identified in the tweet further supports this interpretation, as there are no apparent references to protected groups or discriminatory language beyond the generic and contextually softened ""hate you."" Given this analysis, the classification of the tweet as ""normal"" (or neutral) seems appropriate, as it does not appear to convey actual hatred or intolerance towards any individual or group but rather uses strong language in a colloquial or humorous manner.

Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

It lacks the intention to incite hate or violence, which is key to labeling content as hate speech.

“pocahontas jumps in bed with moslem terrorists interesting combo”

Explanation:
This statement is labeled offensive because it uses derogatory language and stereotypes to insult and demean individuals or groups. Referring to someone as ""Pocahontas"" in a pejorative context is disrespectful, and associating them with ""Muslim terrorists"" perpetuates harmful stereotypes and biases, making the comment offensive and inappropriate.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.

   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.

   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

# Notes:
1. Each explanation should be a single, comprehensive paragraph.
2. Include insights into the tweet's context and the user's intent.
3. Analyze the content through the lens of the provided hate speech definition, discussing the role of key features in your decision.
4. Your detailed assessment will help refine the AI's capabilities in recognizing and differentiating between hate speech, offensive content, and neutral statements.

The tweet contains multiple hateful and derogatory statements toward different groups. The use of the term ""brownies"" to refer to people of color and the slurs ""fags"" and ""dykes"" against the LGBTQ+ community demonstrate homophobia and racism. The statement ""he is bringing America back to her roots"" suggests a regressive or divisive political stance, which may also be interpreted as xenophobic or intolerant. However, since the context of this specific tweet lacks clear intentions or overt calls for violence or harm, it has been labeled as normal under the given dataset and labels provided. Nonetheless, the language used in the statement is highly offensive and disrespectful towards various marginalized communities.

Explanation:

The label ""normal"" may not accurately represent the tweet's content since it contains multiple instances of hate speech targeting people of color and the LGBTQ+ community. The statement ""he is bringing America back to her roots"" implies a negative view of change and progress, which could be interpreted as intolerant or divisive. By using the term ""brownies,"" the user employs a derogatory and dehumanizing description of people of color. Additionally, the use of slurs like ""fags"" and ""dykes"" against the LGBTQ+ community reflects a discriminatory and hateful attitude. Given that the tweet contains several instances of hate speech, it would be more appropriate to label it as such rather than normal.

Label -> Hate Speech

Explanation:

The tweet is classified as hate speech due to its derogatory language towards various marginalized groups. The use of racial slurs, ""brownies,"" dehumanizes people of color by reducing them to an object or dessert rather than recognizing their humanity and individuality. Furthermore, the homophobic slurs, ""fags"" and ""dykes,"" reflect a discriminatory and hateful attitude towards the LGBTQ+ community. The statement ""he is bringing America back to her roots"" may also be interpreted as intolerant or divisive, reflecting a regressive view of society and change. By using such language, the tweet promotes an ""us vs. them"" mentality, fostering division and animosity towards marginalized communities.",22.59

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism.

However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning.

This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals.

The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.

By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric.

Here's my explanation:

This statement is actually a prime example of hate speech because it contains numerous derogatory and offensive terms targeting various groups, including women (""grab any woman by the pussy""), LGBTQ+ individuals (""fags"", ""dykes""), and racial/ethnic minorities (implied by the term ""brownies"", which could be a pejorative reference to people of color). The use of these slurs and epithets is intended to demean, degrade, and dehumanize these groups.

Furthermore, the tweet explicitly endorses and celebrates rape culture (""grab any woman by the pussy""), racism (""you brownies""), homophobia (""fags"", ""dykes""), transphobia (implied by the context), and xenophobia/misogyny (""unpatriotic""). The statement also praises an individual who is described as a ""rapist racist homophobe transphobe"", indicating that these hateful ideologies are being promoted and normalized.

The tone of the tweet is aggressive, hostile, and divisive, with the intention to provoke and offend marginalized groups. The language used is inflammatory, and the message promotes a toxic and discriminatory worldview.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 2: There are no clear key features in the given tweet text that can be directly linked to justifying a normal classification. The lack of specificity in the provided ""key_features"" list is noteworthy, as it might indicate an error or oversight in labeling the text.

Step 3: The target groups in this text are women, Asians, homosexuals, and possibly transgender individuals. The text includes multiple derogatory statements and slurs directed towards these groups, such as ""brownies,"" ""fags,"" and ""dykes.""

By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet has been labeled normal because, despite containing criticisms and negative opinions about someone's actions and ideologies, it does not explicitly contain hate speech or directly offensive language towards a specific group based on protected characteristics such as race, religion, or ethnicity. The mention of ""racist comments about white people"" could imply a concern over reverse racism or discrimination but lacks the context to be definitively classified as hate speech. 

The critique of someone's support for IRA violence and Bolivarian economic policies suggests political disagreement rather than hatred towards an individual or group based on inherent characteristics. The phrase ""the stupid gift that keeps on giving"" is derogatory but appears to be used in a political or ideological context rather than targeting a specific demographic with the intent to incite hate or violence.

However, it's worth noting that the term ""racist comments about white people"" might suggest an acknowledgment of reverse racism, which some systems might flag for further review due to its potential for being interpreted as divisive. Nonetheless, without explicit derogatory language aimed at demeaning a group based on race, religion, ethnicity, or other protected characteristics, and given the political nature of the critique, the statement is categorized as normal under the assumption that it represents a critique of actions and ideologies rather than an attack on individuals based on their identity.",108.29

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Step 2: There are no apparent key features in the text that indicate hate speech, offensive comments, or any specific target group. However, it's worth noting that the mention of ""racist comments about white people"" could potentially be considered offensive if examined in isolation. But, without further context, this statement does not seem to constitute a clear case of hate speech or offensive language.

Step 3: The target appears to be unclear as no specific group is explicitly mentioned. The text mentions ""her,"" but it doesn't indicate who ""she"" is or what her alleged actions and beliefs are in relation to. Thus, without an identifiable target, it is challenging to evaluate how the text affects or refers to a particular group.

Step 4: The overall context of the text involves criticizing someone's statements and actions, which can be perceived as critical or negative but not inherently offensive or hateful. The tone does not appear to be explicitly hostile or threatening toward any group. Instead, it seems more like a commentary on the person's beliefs and actions.

Conclusion: Based on the provided information, this text is classified as ""normal"" or neutral because it lacks clear key features indicative of hate speech or offensive language, there is no identifiable target group, and the context and tone appear to be critical but not inherently harmful.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

This careful analysis is vital for improving our understanding and detection of hate speech, providing nuanced insights into how such speech can be identified and classified accurately.

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.

   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

Step 2: Key features like ""beaner"" are used as a racial slur against individuals of Hispanic origin and, in some contexts, against Muslims. This term aims to demean and discriminate based on ethnicity and/or religion.

Step 3: The target groups, Hispanics and Islam, are explicitly mentioned and negatively characterized through the use of this hateful slur.

Step 4: The overall context and tone of the tweet are not inherently offensive but become so due to the derogatory language used to describe individuals based on their ethnicity and/or religion. The exchange between users appears to be casual, yet the use of such a harmful term underscores the damaging impact it can have on marginalized communities.

Conclusion: This text is offensive as it employs racial slurs targeting two distinct groups – Hispanics and Muslims. Its harmful nature lies in the derogatory language used to demean these individuals based on their ethnicity and/or religion, perpetuating prejudice and discrimination.",19.68

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual.

The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism.

However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning.

This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals.

The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

The tweet is labeled as ""offensive"" because it contains the derogatory term ""beaner,"" which is a racial slur used to refer to people of Hispanic or Latino descent. The use of this term in the context of describing both the kid and the driver implies that their ethnicity is being highlighted in a negative or stereotypical manner. This kind of language perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to a hostile environment for individuals of Hispanic background.

The presence of ""Islam"" as part of the target, despite not being directly referenced in the tweet, might be an error since the term ""beaner"" specifically targets Hispanics rather than Muslims. However, the primary concern here is the use of racist language aimed at the Hispanic community, making the content offensive. 

It's worth noting that similar to other cases where derogatory terms are used, even if not directly intended as hate speech, their usage can still cause harm and perpetuate negative attitudes towards certain groups. The tweet's context does not provide any redeeming or neutralizing factors that would justify the use of such a slur, hence it is classified as offensive due to its potential to offend, insult, or demean individuals based on their ethnicity.",98.46

Step 3: The target is the homosexual community, which is negatively characterized as ""tween dykes"" who supposedly think they are superior because of their perceived oppression.

This statement is labeled as offensive because it uses derogatory language to demean and insult a specific group of individuals, in this case, homosexual females referred to as ""tween dykes"". The term ""dykes"" is often considered a slur when used in a pejorative context. The phrase ""think they are superior to everyone because of muh oppression"" suggests that the speaker believes these individuals are using their experiences of oppression to claim superiority over others, which is portrayed as unwarranted and arrogant. 

The use of ""muh oppression"" is particularly noteworthy as it mocks and minimizes the legitimate struggles and injustices faced by marginalized communities, including homosexuals. This mocking tone contributes to a dismissive and disrespectful attitude towards the issues of oppression and discrimination that these individuals face.

Furthermore, the statement concludes with ""news flash no one gives a shit"", which not only disregards the experiences and feelings of the targeted group but also seeks to invalidate their concerns and presence on the platform (Twitter in this case). This kind of language can contribute to a hostile environment where marginalized groups feel belittled, ignored, or excluded.

   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.

   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers.

The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment.

Step 2: Key features like ""niglets"" and ""blacks"" target African people, using a racial slur to refer to them. Moreover, ""down on their knees"" reinforces a harmful stereotype by depicting African individuals in a submissive role.

This statement is labeled as offensive because it contains a plethora of derogatory and racist language targeting African Americans. The term ""niglets"" is a racial slur, a diminutive form of a highly offensive word for Black people, indicating a demeaning and dehumanizing attitude towards them. 

The phrase ""keep going down on their knees"" is likely referring to the kneeling protests during the National Anthem in NFL games, which were initiated by Colin Kaepernick as a peaceful protest against police brutality and systemic racism. However, in this context, it's used to perpetuate a stereotype of Black people being subservient or submissive.

The mention of ""fake news tv"" and the suggestion that this depiction is the ""only realistic"" one further implies a belief in negative stereotypes about Black people and a distrust of media that might portray them positively or neutrally. 

Moreover, the reference to creating T-shirts with slogans like ""<user> boycott NFL Tebow rule can't pray owners are pleased with their blacks down on their knees"" is highly offensive. It not only uses racist language but also mixes elements of sports (Tebow, a known Christian athlete who kneels in prayer), politics (boycott of the NFL), and racist stereotypes to express disdain for Black athletes' protests and to demean them.

The overall tone is derogatory, dehumanizing, and supportive of racist stereotypes, making it offensive. The use of racial slurs and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes contribute significantly to its offensiveness, targeting African Americans with language that is intended to belittle and demean.",129.66

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet
- target: The intended audience of the tweet
- label: The classification of the tweet (hate speech, offensive, or neutral)

Your explanation should discuss:
- The context and user's intention behind the tweet.
- Why the tweet falls into its assigned category based on the information provided.
- How key features and the specific content of the tweet support your classification.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals.

2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.

- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

Step 1: The label is offensive, which indicates that the content contains derogatory language or harmful stereotypes towards a specific group.

Step 2: Key features like ""obongo"" and ""nigger"" directly refer to former President Barack Obama and use a racial slur against him and his ethnicity. These words are explicitly offensive and demeaning towards African individuals.

Step 3: The target of the text is the African community, as the slur is directed at President Obama, who is an African American. This language has historically been used to dehumanize and discriminate against this group.

Step 4: The overall context and tone are hostile and confrontational. The user's intent appears to be antagonistic towards President Obama and the African community, as suggested by the use of the racial slur and the demand for submission (""obey obey""). This is a clear example of offensive language used to belittle and harm a specific group based on their race.

Conclusion:
This text is classified as offensive because it employs a racial slur towards a specific individual, Barack Obama, and the African community as a whole. The use of derogatory language in this manner aims to dehumanize and discriminate against those targeted.",19.82

Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual. 

2.
“wore a nipsey blue suit today only the niggers in the work place feel the energy”

This tweet has been labeled normal because it seems to be a positive reference of paying tribute to the rapper nipsey hussle who is known for a specific shade of blue that is affiliated to the crib gang culture of LA.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Explanation:

The statement is a factual report of events without any explicit derogatory, hateful, or harmful language targeting a specific individual or group based on characteristics like race, religion, or ethnicity. It lacks the intention to incite hate or violence, which is key to labeling content as hate speech.

“pocahontas jumps in bed with moslem terrorists interesting combo”

Explanation:
This statement is labeled offensive because it uses derogatory language and stereotypes to insult and demean individuals or groups. Referring to someone as ""Pocahontas"" in a pejorative context is disrespectful, and associating them with ""Muslim terrorists"" perpetuates harmful stereotypes and biases, making the comment offensive and inappropriate.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

This statement is labeled offensive because it contains a racial slur (""nigger""), which is a highly derogatory and historically offensive term used to demean and dehumanize individuals of African descent. The use of this term in the context provided perpetuates racism and hatred, contributing to a hostile environment.

The mention of ""obongo"" is likely a derogatory reference to former U.S. President Barack Obama, whose father was from Africa. This nickname, combined with the racial slur, intensifies the offensive nature of the statement by specifically targeting an individual based on his race and ancestry.

Furthermore, the phrase ""white guilt will work"" suggests that the speaker believes there is an attempt to manipulate or shame white individuals into compliance or silence through feelings of guilt over historical injustices, such as racism. This narrative can be seen as dismissive of legitimate concerns about racism and diversity, further contributing to the offensive nature of the statement.

The overall tone and language used in the tweet are divisive and promote racial tension, making it clearly offensive. The reference to being ""taught in schools gov and all media obey"" could imply a belief that there is a concerted effort across institutions to suppress certain viewpoints or opinions, possibly related to race, which the speaker feels are being unfairly marginalized or silenced. However, the manner in which this point is made, through the use of highly offensive language, undermines any potential argument and instead serves to incite hatred or intolerance towards individuals based on their race.",120.01

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.

Label -> Normal

1.
""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual.

Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the ""energy"" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.

Label -> Hate Speech
1)you niggas is fake asl that why you dont see none round me

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (""niggas""), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone. The inclusion of aggressive language further amplifies its hateful nature.


2) ""online nazi haha guys the left can not meme <number> white privilege diversity is our strength race is just skin color the holocaust racist sexist bigot homophobe islamophobe anti semite""

Explanation:
This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like ""white privilege,"" ""diversity is our strength,"" and ""anti-Semite."" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to ""Nazi"" and ""the Holocaust"" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies. Overall, the statement ridicules efforts to address inequality and promotes hostility, making it hate speech.

Explanation:
This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (""niggers""). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people ""hate you because you are white and you exist."" This kind of language fosters an ""us vs. them"" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like ""proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force"" and ""altright"" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

This statement is labeled as offensive because it contains derogatory language and promotes a divisive, anti-Muslim sentiment. The term ""lowlife"" is used to insult the mainstream media (msm), implying that they are of low moral character. The phrase ""moslems in nrth londonistan"" uses a pejorative suffix (-istan) to refer to an area with a high Muslim population, which can be seen as dehumanizing and dismissive.

Furthermore, the tweet attempts to distance the perpetrator of a violent act (ramming a van into Muslims) from ""anti-moslem patriots with brains,"" implying that there is a justified or rational basis for anti-Muslim sentiment. The phrase ""about <percent> of uk are there"" suggests that a significant portion of the UK population shares this anti-Muslim view, which can contribute to a hostile environment for Muslim individuals.

The use of terms like ""moslems"" instead of ""Muslims"" and the overall tone of the tweet reflect a biased and discriminatory attitude towards Muslims and Islam. The reference to Tommy Robinson and Britain First, known for their anti-Islam and far-right ideologies, further solidifies the tweet's alignment with extremist views. Overall, the language and sentiment expressed in this tweet are offensive and contribute to a divisive, hate-filled narrative targeting Arab and Islamic communities.",110.1

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.

   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:

   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.

Step 3: The target of the text includes Arabs and Islam. The use of ""lowlife"" to describe MSM (Mainstream Media) and the derogatory term ""nrth londonistan"" for London perpetuates negative stereotypes about these groups.

This statement is labeled as offensive because it contains several derogatory terms and stereotypes.

The invocation of Freud in a derogatory manner while using his ethnic background as an insult further compounds the offense by targeting Jewish individuals.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.

The user's intention seems to be criticizing one form of hate speech while inadvertently (or perhaps intentionally) perpetuating another, highlighting a complex but ultimately harmful expression that fits into the ""offensive"" category due to its use of pejorative language targeting African and Jewish individuals. This classification is appropriate given the definition of hate speech as discriminatory or pejorative towards an individual or group based on identity factors such as religion, ethnicity, or race, even though the user may have initially sought to condemn similar behavior in others.",113.21

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

""i know this is somewhat hypocritical but what the fuck is the deal with queer guys and slightly too small white tshirts""

Explanation:
The tweet has been labeled normal because the user is solely expressing an observation. However the use of vulgar terms such as “fuck” may indicate that the user has a rather negative outlook towards topics concerning queers. Given that the context is not clear it may be understood as a neutral observation. The targets used within the dataset do not contain the word “queer” but the word homosexual.

Explanation:
The use of the term ""niggers"" is offensive and rooted in racism.

The tweet has been labeled as normal because it appears to be a part of a discussion about violence and safety concerns. The user acknowledges that men can commit male violence and expresses concern for the well-being of a lesbian who might be confronted with a penis, specifically in the context of potential rape or physical harm from a trans woman if the lesbian were to turn down advances. 

Although the tweet touches on sensitive topics such as sexual violence and discrimination, it does so in a manner that seems to prioritize understanding and empathy rather than promoting hate or violence. The user's expression of not envying the position of a lesbian in such a situation suggests a consideration for the potential fears and vulnerabilities involved.

It's worth noting that discussions around gender identity, sexual orientation, and violence can be complex and require nuanced understanding. This tweet seems to approach these topics with a focus on the potential for harm and the importance of safety, rather than using derogatory language or promoting discriminatory beliefs. However, interpretations may vary based on individual perspectives and contexts, especially considering the delicate nature of the subjects discussed. 

The key points that lead to this classification as ""normal"" include:
- The acknowledgment of male violence without glorification.
- The expression of concern for potential victims of sexual violence or physical harm.
- The absence of overtly derogatory language towards any group, despite discussing sensitive and potentially controversial topics.

Step 2: There are no apparent key features in this text that can be directly linked to hate speech or offense. The statement starts with a user acknowledging that men commit male violence. This factual observation does not contain any derogatory language towards men as a whole.

Step 3: The text mentions ""a lesbian being confronted with a penis"" and ""being raped or beaten for turning down the trans woman,"" suggesting potential harm to certain individuals, but it is not targeted at all men. It is important to note that discussing instances of harm does not automatically make a statement offensive or hateful towards an entire group.

As a hate speech specialist, your task is to analyze tweets to determine if they contain hate speech, offensive content, 
or are neutral. Hate speech can be conveyed through any form of expression. 
Hate speech is “discriminatory” (biased, bigoted, or intolerant) or “pejorative” (prejudiced, contemptuous, or demeaning) of an individual or group. 
Hate speech calls out real or perceived “identity factors” of an individual or a group, including: “religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, color, descent, gender,” 
but also characteristics such as language, economic or social origin, disability, health status, or sexual orientation, among many others.

Here are some examples to illustrate:
- ""Nigga"", ""Bitch"" // Offensive: This term is offensive as it historically derogates African Americans and Women.
- ""A negro moslem doctor got struck off for negligence when a white <number> year old kid with down syndrome died; the guardian's response is to help promote a crowdfunding campaign for her"" // Hate speech: This statement is hate speech as it discriminates based on race and religion, promoting negative stereotypes.
- ""Smiling cuz I am young black rich and I am handsome!"" // No hate speech: This expression is a positive self-description and does not target or degrade any other group.

For each tweet provided, you will analyze:
- tweet_text: The text of the tweet
- key_features: Significant words or phrases identified in the tweet

Additionally, references to historical events such as ""granddaddy fought the Nazis"" and ""great great grandad ground the Confederacy"" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals.

You are tasked with providing a detailed explanation of why a given text is classified as hate speech, offensive, or neutral, based on annotations provided. Follow a step-by-step reasoning process to justify the classification, considering the context, user's intent, and linguistic features.

The dataset provides the following information:
- tweet_text: The main user text requiring explanation.
- key_features: Words or phrases crucial to the decision.
- target: The audience or group targeted by the text.
- label: The classification of the text (hate speech, offensive, or neutral).

Your job is to:
1. Start by identifying the label of the text and summarizing what it indicates about the content.
2. Analyze the key features and explain how they support the classification.
3. Consider the target and evaluate how the text affects or refers to this group.
4. Examine the overall context and tone to understand the user's intent.
5. Conclude with a detailed explanation, justifying the classification and the reasoning behind it.

Guidelines:
- If the label is neutral, but you believe the text could be hate speech, explain why it is still considered neutral.
- If the label is offensive, describe the nature of the offense and how the key features contribute to it.
- Ensure the explanation is in one clear paragraph, summarizing the reasoning process.
- Highlight what helped in making the decision and why the text is classified as it is.

Here are examples for guidance:

1. **Hate Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""All [group] people should be eliminated.""
   - key_features: [""eliminated"", ""[group] people""]
   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group
   - label: Hate Speech
   Reasoning: 
   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""eliminated"" express a clear call for harm, targeting ""[group] people.""  
   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  
   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  
   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.

2. **Offensive**:
   - tweet_text: ""Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?""
   - key_features: [""men"", ""bad at taking care""]
   - target: Men
   - label: Offensive
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  
   Step 2: Key features like ""bad at taking care"" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  
   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  
   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  
   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.

3. **Neutral**:
   - tweet_text: ""What’s everyone’s favorite food?""
   - key_features: None
   - target: None
   - label: Neutral
   Reasoning:
   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  
   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  
   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  
   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  
   Conclusion: This text is neutral because it is non-controversial, lacks harmful language, and does not target any individual or group.

Now, write an explanation for the given input using this reasoning framework.
","{'post_id': '1178618820229025793_twitter', 'tweet_text': '<user> <user> <user> yes men commit male violence i actually wouldnt envy a lesbian being confonted with a penis for a number of reasons the fear of being raped or being beaten for turning down the trans woman being just one', 'key_features': [], 'target': 'Men, None', 'label': 'normal'}","The label of this text is classified as ""normal,"" which may seem counterintuitive given the sensitive and potentially inflammatory content. Step 1: The classification as normal suggests that despite discussing serious issues like violence and rape, the overall intent and context do not align with hate speech or overtly offensive categorizations. Step 2: Although there are no explicitly listed key features, phrases such as ""men commit male violence"" and ""fear of being raped or being beaten"" are crucial in understanding the tone and content of the message. These phrases, while discussing violent acts, are presented in a context that appears to acknowledge and condemn such behaviors rather than promote them. Step 3: The target groups mentioned are men and, indirectly, transgender women and lesbians, but the text does not demean or directly attack these groups; instead, it discusses potential fears and dangers associated with interactions involving violence or the threat of it. Step 4: Examining the context and tone, the user seems to be expressing a concern or acknowledgment of issues related to gender-based violence rather than inciting hatred or offense. The mention of not envying a lesbian being confronted with certain situations suggests a discussion on vulnerability and safety concerns. Conclusion: This text is classified as normal because, despite touching on very serious and potentially offensive topics like violence against women and transgender individuals, the context provided frames these discussions as acknowledgments of existing social issues rather than promoting hatred or offense towards any group. The intent appears to be more about highlighting fears and dangers in a manner that seeks understanding or discussion, which aligns more closely with a neutral or normal classification than with hate speech or overtly offensive content.",125.73
