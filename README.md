<h1 style="color:blue;">Developing an Agent for Hate Speech Detection.</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

We are developing a cutting-edge hate speech detection agent to identify and mitigate harmful content on social media platforms. Our approach combines advanced language models, psychological insights, and minimal labeled data to create a robust, context-aware detection tool. The key objectives of our project are:

Accurate Detection: Build a reliable agent for identifying hate speech in diverse contexts.
Topic Analysis: Extract and analyze key topics from social media posts for targeted detection.
Efficient Training: Use unsupervised techniques to train the agent with minimal labeled data.
Current Status

We are in the planning phase, setting up this repository and organizing research to prepare for development. Our focus includes:

Reviewing existing methods for hate speech detection.
Defining workflows and project milestones.
Exploring datasets and training strategies.
