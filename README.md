TWON Project

Overview

TWin of Online Social Networks (TWON) is an EU-funded initiative to explore the societal impacts of social media platforms. By creating a digital twin of these networks, TWON aims to tackle challenges such as:

- Disinformation spread
- Radicalization and extreme opinions
- Social polarization

About Us

Weâ€™re a team of five students contributing to TWON through a research case study. Our focus is on building a hate speech detection agent that identifies and mitigates harmful content on social media.

Goals

Hate Speech Detection Agent: Build an accurate, context-aware detection tool using advanced language models.
Topic Extraction: Develop techniques to analyze social media posts for focused detection.
Unsupervised Tuning: Train the agent with minimal labeled data.
Current Status

This repository is in the setup phase. We are currently organizing our research, defining workflows, and preparing for development. Stay tuned for updates!
