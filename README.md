<h1 style="color:blue;">Developing an Agent for Hate Speech Detection.</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We are developing a state-of-the-art hate speech detection agent designed to identify and mitigate harmful content on social media platforms. Our approach integrates advanced language models, psychological insights, and minimal labeled data to craft a robust, context-aware detection tool that not only detects but also explains the nuances of hate speech.</p>

<h2>Key Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accurate Detection:</strong> Build a reliable agent that identifies hate speech across diverse contexts.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed Explanations:</strong> Provide clear, understandable explanations for the detection decisions, enhancing transparency.</li>
  <li><strong>Severity Assessment:</strong> Evaluate the severity of detected hate speech to guide response strategies.</li>
  <li><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Offer actionable suggestions based on the severity, assisting moderators and platform managers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>We are currently using the HateXplain dataset, which is pre-labeled with categories: Hate Speech, Offensive, and Normal. Our experiments with various prompting techniques—chain of thought, few-shot, and zero-shot—aim to refine the explanations provided by our model. 
A comprehensive survey has been conducted, assessing not only which explanations were preferred by participants but also collecting demographic data including their job roles and ages. This survey further explored participants' trust in AI's capabilities to effectively detect hate speech, underscoring our project's commitment to understanding the social and psychological dimensions of hate speech detection. The feedback and demographic analysis are instrumental in developing a tool that resonates well with diverse user groups. The most effective explanation method, as determined by the survey, will be integrated into our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework.</p>

<h2>Part of the TWON Initiative</h2>

This project is undertaken as part of the TWin of Online Social Networks (TWON), an EU-funded research initiative studying the societal impacts of online social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok. By contributing to TWON, we aim to foster healthier online environments and reduce societal harm.
