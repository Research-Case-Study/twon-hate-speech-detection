# Research Plan for Creating a Simple User Interface

## Introduction
This document outlines the research plan for identifying the best tools, frameworks, and libraries for creating a well suited user interface (UI) for our project. The goal is to evaluate available options that are well-suited for rapid development and ease of use, considering our specific project requirements.

## Project Components
### Frontend
The **frontend** of our application is what users will interact with directly. It includes all the graphical elements like buttons, text fields, and images, as well as the layout that organizes these elements on the web page. Our aim is to create an intuitive and responsive interface that allows users to easily navigate and use the features of our application, such as submitting text for analysis, viewing results, and receiving feedback.

### Backend
The **backend** serves as the backbone of our application, handling the processing of user data, storing information, and communicating with the frontend. It will operate on a server and manage tasks like analyzing input data, storing user submissions, and sending processed data back to the frontend. The goal for the backend is to ensure reliable processing, secure data management, and smooth communication with the frontend.

## Objectives
- Identifying the most efficient and user-friendly tools and frameworks for UI development
- Compareing features, community support and ease of use
- Recommending the best options for our specific needs
  
## Research Criteria
### 1. **Platform Compatibility**
   - Determine which platforms (web, mobile, desktop) each tool supports.
### 2. **Ease of Use**
   - Assess the learning curve and user-friendliness of each tool.

## Research Methodology
### 1. **Literature Review**
   - Review articles, blogs, and tutorials to get a preliminary understanding of the tools.
### 2. **Tool Comparison**
   - Create a comparison chart of features, pros, and cons for each tool.

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this research, we aim to:
- Identify the most suitable frontend tools and frameworks that will enable us to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
- Determine the best backend technologies that will efficiently handle data processing, storage, and communication with the frontend.
- Be prepared to make an informed decision on which combination of tools and frameworks to adopt for the seamless integration of our project's frontend and backend.

## Detailed Plan and Timeline
### Until Friday (31.01.25)
  - Completed literature review to gather preliminary data about potential tools
  - Drafting a comparison chart of the tools based on features, ease of use, compatibilty 
- **Ideally**:
  - If possible, conducting quick hands-on testing of the most promising tools using trial versions or demos
  - Evaluate the initial feel and fit of these tools for both frontend and backend development
