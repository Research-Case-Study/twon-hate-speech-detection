## Description
This project aims to enhance transparency in hate speech detection on social media by researching the explainability of detection systems. We are developing an agent that provides clear explanations for why content is classified as neutral, offensive, or hate speech.

## Objective
To support our research, we will conduct a survey to evaluate how individuals perceive and assess these explanations. We aim to understand how individuals evaluate AI-generated explanations for classifying social media content as neutral, offensive, or hate speech.
The survey focuses on three key areas:

1.Demographics
Collecting participants’ age, gender, nationality, and educational background to guarantee diverse perspectives.

2. Evaluation of Explanations
Participants will assess explanations for content classification, highlighting factors like clarity, plausibility, and fairness. This provides empirical data on which aspects of explanations influence user perceptions. By considering  these factors we can optimize explanations to improve the quality of our agents output.

3. Perspectives on Hate Speech and AI
Exploring participants’ experiences with online hate speech and their trust in AI moderation and explanatory systems. This information is crucial for understanding how users' experiences with hate speech shape their evaluation of AI explanations.
