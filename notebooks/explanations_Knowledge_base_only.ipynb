The comparison is made to criticize and reject such reasoning, rather than promoting or perpetuating harm towards any group. The absence of key features and a specified target also supports the classification as \"normal,\" indicating that the annotator saw this as a critique of a harmful mindset rather than an instance of hate speech itself. The explanation and argumentation presented aim to highlight the fallacy in blaming victims, which is a stance against, rather than in support of, discriminatory or hateful views. Therefore, despite the use of strong language, the tweet's intent appears to be about challenging harmful attitudes, not promoting them.\n",
