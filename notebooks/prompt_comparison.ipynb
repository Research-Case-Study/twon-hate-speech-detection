    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The use of the term \"niggers\" is offensive and rooted in racism. Even if no direct harm or attack is evident, it perpetuates a derogatory term, which many systems and definitions include as hate speech. However, disagreement in labeling often arises due to contextual interpretations. Example for that could be Cultural or Social Context that goes Intended Meaning. In the tweet addition The phrase might be interpreted as describing a situation where the \"energy\" of the outfit is appreciated by a certain group, which could be seen as neutral, despite the offensive language.\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses a racial slur (\"niggas\"), which is historically and culturally offensive, particularly against Black individuals. Even when used in some contexts as reclaimed language, its use in this statement appears derogatory, contributing to a hostile and discriminatory tone.

    "This statement is hate speech because it mocks and trivializes serious societal issues, such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, using a sarcastic tone to dismiss terms like \"white privilege,\" \"diversity is our strength,\" and \"anti-Semite.\" By doing so, it undermines the significance of these issues and belittles those advocating for equality. References to \"Nazi\" and \"the Holocaust\" in a dismissive context further minimize historical atrocities and signal alignment with extremist ideologies.

    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "This statement is classified as hate speech because it uses the racial slur (\"niggers\"). The statement further vilifies an entire group by making sweeping generalizations, such as claiming that Black people \"hate you because you are white and you exist.\" This kind of language fosters an \"us vs. them\" narrative, portraying Black people as inherently hostile toward white people, which promotes racial division and resentment. The inclusion of terms like \"proto Bolshevik Yankee gubment force\" and \"altright\" reflects alignment with extremist ideologies often associated with white nationalism and discriminatory rhetoric. Additionally, references to historical events such as \"granddaddy fought the Nazis\" and \"great great grandad ground the Confederacy\" are weaponized to evoke a sense of pride in white heritage while simultaneously vilifying Black individuals. \n",

    "   - target: A specific ethnic or religious group\n",

    "   Reasoning: \n",
    "   Step 1: The label is hate speech, which indicates that the content is intended to incite harm or violence against a group.  \n",
    "   Step 2: Key features like \"eliminated\" express a clear call for harm, targeting \"[group] people.\"  \n",
    "   Step 3: The target is a specific ethnic or religious group, making this statement particularly harmful.  \n",
    "   Step 4: The context and tone show a violent intention to exclude and harm the group.  \n",
    "   Conclusion: This text qualifies as hate speech due to its explicit incitement of violence and harm directed toward a specific group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Offensive**:\n",
    "   - tweet_text: \"Why are men so bad at taking care of kids?\"\n",

    "   - target: Men\n",
    "   - label: Offensive\n",
    "   Reasoning:\n",
    "   Step 1: The label is offensive, which suggests the text contains harmful stereotypes or derogatory assumptions.  \n",
    "   Step 2: Key features like \"bad at taking care\" perpetuate a stereotype that questions men’s abilities in caregiving.  \n",
    "   Step 3: The target is men, a group generalized and negatively characterized in this statement.  \n",
    "   Step 4: While the tone is not explicitly harmful, the language dismisses and demeans the target group.  \n",
    "   Conclusion: This text is offensive because it perpetuates a harmful stereotype about men, although it does not incite direct harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Neutral**:\n",
    "   - tweet_text: \"What’s everyone’s favorite food?\"\n",
    "   - key_features: None\n",
    "   - target: None\n",
    "   - label: Neutral\n",
    "   Reasoning:\n",
    "   Step 1: The label is neutral, meaning the text does not contain offensive or harmful language.  \n",
    "   Step 2: There are no key features or elements that suggest hostility, harm, or stereotypes.  \n",
    "   Step 3: The content is inclusive and general, without targeting any group or individual.  \n",
    "   Step 4: The context and tone are friendly and open-ended, with no intent to harm or offend.  \n",
