Key features:
- Criticism of government spending on undocumented immigrants.
- Call for addressing a perceived problem without offering a solution.
- No direct hate speech or slurs against any community.

The tweet's target appears to be the government or policymakers, rather than any particular ethnic or social group. The user expresses frustration over political decisions but does not employ language typically associated with hate speech or severe offensiveness.

The target of this text is clearly African or black people, implied by the usage of the slur. The tone of the statement is aggressive and hostile, promoting a narrative of violent crime being acceptable when committed by a specific ethnic group and motivated by racial animosity.

- The tweet is straightforward and informative, focusing solely on sharing a culinary tip.
- There is an absence of any contentious language or sensitive topics.
- The tone is neutral, without any indication of hostility or prejudice towards any group or individual.

Given these considerations, the tweet maintains a light-hearted and non-confrontational tone. It does not contain any explicit or implicit targeting of specific groups, nor does it employ language that could be construed as inflammatory or pejorative.

This term typically refers to working-class Caucasians, particularly from rural areas in the Southern United States, and its use can perpetuate stereotypes and social stigmas associated with this group.

Key Features:
- The word **""redneck""** is a pivotal feature influencing the classification. Despite the user's claim that the term isn't racially motivated and is used widely across the South, it still holds negative connotations when applied to a specific demographic in a generalized manner.
  
Target Group:
- The target group appears to be Caucasians from the Southern United States, identified by the use of ""redneck."" This term can be seen as targeting not just a geographical group but also implying certain socioeconomic and cultural characteristics.

Intent Analysis: 
- While the user attempts to downplay the potentially racial or targeted nature of the term by suggesting it's commonly used in the South, the context does little to mitigate the offensiveness. The intent seems to normalize the use of ""redneck,"" which could further its pejorative impact.

Conclusion:
The tweet is classified as **Offensive** primarily due to the inclusion of the term ""redneck"" and its associated negative stereotypes. Despite the user's assertion that it isn't a racial thing, the term itself carries cultural baggage that can be perceived as targeting a specific demographic in a derisory manner, hence justifying the classification.",33.66,[-2.4451709 -1.8589376  1.2319938 ...  2.2314498 -2.9523792  8.535674 ],2, Offensive.

The text is categorized as hate speech primarily due to its use of highly derogatory and inflammatory language targeting African nations (""shithole"") and the Islamic religious group (""muzzies""). 

- **Key Features**: The terms ""shithole"" and ""muzzies"" are central to this classification. ""Shithole"" is a crude, degrading term often used to demean regions or countries, particularly those in Africa. ""Muzzies,"" a contraction of ""Muslims,"" is an overtly Islamophobic slur that perpetuates negative stereotypes about the Islamic faith and its followers.
  
- **Impact on Target Groups**: This language not only demeans individuals from African nations but also vilifies Muslims, fostering animosity towards these groups. The user's opposition to sending aid (""troops and money"") underscores a disdain for supporting these populations.

- **Context and Tone**: The context of arguing against assistance and the dismissive tone with ""all kumbaya over saving africans"" further solidify this as hate speech. It portrays efforts to help Africans as naïve and unworthy, using mocking language (""kumbaya"") that undermines genuine humanitarian concerns.
  
**Conclusion**: 
The tweet is classified as hate speech due to its deliberate use of aggressive slurs against specific ethnic and religious groups, advocating against aid with a demeaning tone. This classification is justified by the explicit targeting of vulnerable communities with highly provocative language intended to incite hatred or contempt.",33.4,[ 2.102138  -1.7679125 -5.0271654 ...  3.829117  -5.7542644  2.3611155],0, offensive.

The author expresses that if such language is used in negotiations involving them, it should immediately terminate the discussion with prejudice.

Key points supporting this classification include:
- The explicit mention of a phrase (""shithole countries"") known for its pejorative and racist connotations.
- The strong reaction proposed (""end of negotiations"", ""great prejudice"") against using such language.
- No specific group is targeted in a negative light beyond the hypothetical person using the slur.

Though the text contains an offensive phrase, it's used to condemn the act of employing such language. Therefore, despite its reference to hate speech, it doesn't promote or endorse these views. Instead, it advocates for ending negotiations if such language is employed. This context justifies its classification as 'normal'.

In summary, while the text references a highly charged phrase, it does so within a context that opposes racism and prejudice. It neither incites hatred nor offends a group but communicates a zero-tolerance policy towards bigotry.",24.45,"[-0.87274325  5.1081295  -3.3141541  ...  8.459824    0.30098504

Explanation: The text expresses a strong bias and prejudice towards individuals based on their race, referring to ""black people"" as being from ""shithole countries."" This language is derogatory, dehumanizing, and offensive, and it indicates an intention to discriminate against people based on their race. The use of such hateful language in the context of business negotiations demonstrates a clear intention to exclude individuals based on their race, which is a form of hate speech."

1. The label 'normal' indicates that while the text expresses frustration, it does not contain overtly aggressive or targeted language typical of hate speech.

2. Key features include strong language like ""fuck capitalism"" and ""can choke"", expressing dissatisfaction with Disney's business practices but falling short of advocating harm or using slurs, which would be indicative of hate speech.

3. The target of the text is Disney, a corporation, not a marginalized group. Criticizing corporate actions does not on its own constitute hate speech, especially in the absence of language designed to dehumanize or promote violence against a protected class.

4. The tone is critical and colorful but lacks the intense vitriol or calls to action that characterize hate speech. It advocates for change in business practices by supporting small creators rather than inciting harm.

5. In conclusion, despite the strong language used, this text falls into the normal category because it critiques a company's approach without employing dehumanizing or overtly aggressive rhetoric aimed at marginalized groups, which is fundamental to hate speech classification.",25.04,[ 3.1247854  4.874093   1.1719886 ... 10.58749   -9.692702   5.363655 ],1, normal

Upon analysis, the text contains inflammatory language and targets specific groups in a hostile manner. 

Key features supporting an alternative classification:
- The phrase ""the tolerant left"" employs sarcasm to criticize liberal ideologies.
- Accusations of killing children without consequences are extreme and provocative.
- Expecting taxpayers to fund unspecified actions suggests exploitation. 
- Hoping pro-human people get raped is an explicit threat of sexual violence.

These elements converge to create a text that incites hostility towards political opponents and advocates for harm against them. The combination of inflammatory rhetoric, personal attacks, and calls for violence categorize this as hate speech.

In conclusion, the tweet's sarcastic tone, extreme accusations, and direct threats justify reclassifying it from normal to hate speech.

Explanation: The text appears to express a negative sentiment towards a specific group (the ""tolerant left"") and uses harsh language (""killing children consequence free"" and ""hoping pro human people get raped""). While it may not be explicitly targeting a particular race, gender, or other protected characteristic, the tone and language used could be perceived as offensive and inflammatory. The statement lacks explicit harm or hostility towards any particular community, but it does contain strong negative sentiment and potentially inflammatory language."

It does not contain any elements of hate speech or explicit offensiveness.

Key features that support this classification:
- The use of ""sad"" and description of harassment imply a negative experience, but do not directly insult or demean any group.
- Mentioning being read as queer due to short hair suggests an LGBT context, but is stated matter-of-factly without derision.
- The text does not target anyone with hate or bigotry; it's a personal account of experiencing social discomfort.

The user shares their struggle of feeling out of place in a conservative hometown and facing harassment linked to their appearance and perceived sexual orientation. This adds a layer of empathy rather than offense to the text. 

Despite the serious undertone, the inclusion of emojis at the end lightens the overall mood. This further supports its neutral classification, as it shows an attempt at softening the severity of the situation.

In summary, while the tweet conveys a personal challenge, it avoids using aggressive or derogatory language towards any group and focuses on sharing an individual experience. Thus, it is appropriately classified as normal based on its content and tone.",26.38,"[ 2.6299634   0.64959806 -0.17679383 ...  8.071494   -3.0180748

Explanation: The user expresses disappointment and unhappiness about experiencing harassment in their grandpa's conservative hometown due to their appearance and being perceived as queer. Although it doesn't explicitly contain hate speech, the mention of the negative experience might be considered offensive by some, especially since it revolves around the user's sexual orientation and past experiences of discrimination."

This word choice indicates an intent to offend and perpetuate negative stereotypes about the Jewish community, making the classification as hate speech unequivocal.

Key Features:
- The usage of ""kike"" is central to understanding the text's malicious intent towards its target group.
- There are no mitigating factors in the text that would suggest a different interpretation or intent behind using this slur.

Target Group Impact:
- The Jewish community is directly targeted by this language, which serves to demean and insult them based on their religious and cultural identity.

Context and Tone Assessment:
- The phrase ""naming the kike"" implies an act of openly expressing bigotry against Jewish individuals.
- The assertion that such naming is ""just and righteous"" attempts to justify and normalize this hate speech.

Conclusion:
The text's use of a severe ethnic slur coupled with language rationalizing its usage justifies its classification as hate speech. This determination is based on the explicit targeting of a religious group through deeply offensive terminology, indicating an intent to harm and promote bigotry against Jewish people.",26.39,"[ 0.80533874  5.3592057   2.619887   ...  9.723932   -4.2145653

2. **Key Features Absent**: 
    - There are no explicit keywords provided that would directly classify this as hate speech or overtly offensive language.

3. **Evaluation of Impact**:
   - The mention of ""little Asian women"" being targeted for heinous acts implies a clear target group, raising concerns about potential bigotry and violence against a specific demographic.
   
4. **Context and Tone Assessment**:
    - The context involves serious criminal allegations and psychological analysis rather than explicit hate speech or casual offensiveness.

5. **Conclusion Justifying Classification**:

This classification is based on the absence of direct hate speech or overtly offensive language targeting a specific group.

While phrases like ""gay baby jail"" and ""drinking demon blood"" might seem provocative, they lack clear context connecting them to real-world groups in a malicious way. The bizarre, surreal nature suggests an attempt at humor rather than serious invective.

Without evident intent to demean or harm a target demographic through the language used, the tweet doesn't meet criteria for hate speech or even offensiveness. It appears more an obscure joke than meaningful social commentary.

In conclusion, while imaginative and edgy in tone, this statement's lack of discernible malice towards others places it in the neutral category upon balanced analysis.

The key feature ""faggot"" is an explicit and derogatory term used to demean individuals based on their sexual orientation, specifically targeting homosexuals in this context.

This classification is further supported by the aggressive tone set by the phrase ""ima fuck up"", which indicates intent to harm or insult. Additionally, the use of ""pony stupid emo"" adds to the insulting nature of the text, employing stereotypes associated with emotional vulnerability and alternative subcultures. 

The impact on the target group is significant as it perpetuates negative attitudes towards homosexuality and creates a hostile environment. The user's intent appears to be to offend and assert dominance over the target by utilizing such loaded language.

In conclusion, this text falls into the ""offensive"" category due to its use of explicit homophobic slurs and aggressive tone that targets individuals based on their sexual orientation.

1. The label 'normal' implies that the text does not contain hate speech or overtly offensive content. In this case, the tweet appears to be a casual comment about adding time for something related to ""grapetooth,"" which seems to be a playful or fictional creature based on the emoji used.

The key features, specifically the words ""kill"" and ""queers,"" are crucial in understanding the severity of this classification. These terms convey a clear intent to incite harm and promote discrimination against individuals based on their sexual orientation.

The usage of religious justification (""god told his people"") further intensifies the hate speech, as it attempts to legitimize violence by attributing it to a divine command. This not only targets homosexuals but also manipulates religious sentiments to normalize hostility towards them.

Key features like ""queers,"" ""murderous abortionists,"" and ""culture of death"" reveal a strong bias against homosexuals and individuals who support or provide abortions. The phrase ""side with the murderous abortionists"" insinuates that members of one group are allied with those viewed as killers, fostering animosity towards both groups.

The target of this text includes the homosexual community (referred to as 'queers') and women seeking abortions or supporting reproductive rights ('abortionists'). By associating these groups with death and murder, the author aims to vilify them. The term ""grisly club"" further exacerbates the hostile tone by suggesting that these groups are part of a sinister collective.

The overall context and tone demonstrate clear intent to denigrate and incite hostility against the targeted communities. This is not a case of mere offensiveness but a deliberate propagation of hate, hence its classification as hate speech. The choice of words creates an us-versus-them dynamic, exacerbating social divisions and promoting harm.

The tweet directly references and denigrates the target group, Africans, with no context or nuance that could potentially mitigate its offensiveness. The tone is aggressive and dehumanizing, clearly showcasing a strong animosity towards the targeted community.

The tweet employs slurs and negative stereotypes, targeting both Islam and individuals from developing nations. Key phrases like ""moslem"" (a misspelled slur for Muslim) and ""from a shit hole country"" reveal an intent to demean based on religious beliefs and nationality.

1. The tweet includes phrases like ""crazy slutty women"" and ""one egg and a green card"". These phrases are suggestive of stereotypes or negative generalizations about certain groups of people. 
2. There is also an implied criticism of older white women which, while not explicitly aggressive, does carry a tone of judgment or disdain.
3. The tweet seems to be referring to some form of media (possibly a television show), indicating that the user's opinions are influenced by the portrayals in this media.

This text is not just critical but employs aggressive and abusive language to demean and provoke the target group. It does more than express dislike; it incites hatred with the use of shocking epithets that have historical baggage, aimed at stirring emotional distress in its audience. 

The tone here is inflammatory, leveraging terms known for their high potential to offend and marginalize. The user's intent seems not merely to voice displeasure but to shock, insult, and potentially mobilize others against the identified targets.

However, upon closer examination:

1. The label's implication suggests that while the phrase ""lightskin bitch"" contains a pejorative term and refers to complexion, it lacks clear indicators of malicious intent or targeted hate towards women or any specific group.

2. Key features are not explicitly provided, but ""bitch"" is typically considered an insulting term for a woman. Yet, without additional context about the speaker's intent or audience reaction, its impact remains ambiguous.

3. The text references complexion and personality traits (""dark side""), which could carry negative connotations but do not directly incite harm or promote stereotypes against women.

4. Assessing the tone and user intent is challenging without more background information, but no overt hostility or aggression towards women is evident from this lone phrase.

In conclusion, while ""bitch"" can be a loaded term, classifying this text as normal acknowledges that without further context or clear signs of malice, it stops short of hate speech.

1. **Language Use**: The use of terms like 'hobgoblin' and 'yid' are critical in identifying the offensiveness. 'Hobgoblin', while often used in fantasy contexts, is employed here mockingly. 'Yid' is a term with anti-Semitic connotations, further classifying this tweet as hate speech.
   
2. **Mocking Tone**: The request to imitate a ""squeaky hobgoblin yid voice"" reinforces a derisory intent, mocking the stereotyped manner of speech attributed to Jewish people.

3. **Target Group**: The tweet specifically targets individuals of Jewish descent through the use of 'yid', a term often used in an anti-Semitic context. 

4. **Context and Tone**: Despite the initial casual tone set by ""haha holy fuck"", the subsequent content reveals a prejudiced mocking intent, making it clear that this is not a neutral or good-natured post.

The tweet's offense stems from its use of language with negative connotations towards Jewish individuals and its mocking tone.

3. Target Group Impact: 
   - The target group is Caucasian women, specifically one who has appeared on a reality television show. By referring to this individual as ""trailer trash,"" the text employs classist and misogynistic language that demeans her based on perceived socio-economic status and gender.

- Reference to a ""diversity video full of white people"": This points out a lack of diversity, but doesn't employ hate speech or direct offense.
- Phrase ""trust me very painful for the minority very painful"": Conveys empathy towards minorities without using abusive language.

The user seems to question the logic behind certain immigration trends rather than expressing hate or offense towards any group specifically.

The target audience mentioned includes women and African-Americans. The inclusion of these groups alongside pejorative terms highlights the tweet's intent to demean and insult on the basis of race and gender.

The tweet explicitly calls out a writer and a TV personality, indicating a targeted campaign of defamation under the guise of political satire. The mention of MAGA (Make America Great Again) caps further reinforces the political angle but does not mitigate the harm caused by the inflammatory language used.

The phrase structure also draws a parallel between these two minority groups in a clearly negative and hostile manner.

The target of this hate speech is twofold - African people, referred to using the n-word slur; and Muslims, disparagingly called ""muzzies"". By equating the two groups and referencing past mistreatment of African Americans, the user is invoking a disturbing comparison that advocates for similarly poor outcomes for Muslims.

The tone is overtly antagonistic, with no attempt at civility or reasoned discussion. Instead, the message is one of raw bigotry and intolerance, intended to stoke animosity against already marginalized communities.

Explanation:
- The text makes a direct comparison between ""Muzzies"" (an offensive term for Muslims) and ""niggers,"" a highly provocative and historically loaded racial slur.
- By drawing this comparison, the speaker is expressing a prejudiced view towards Muslims, borrowing the negative connotations associated with the term ""nigger.""
- This comparison serves to demean and stereotype an entire religious group, echoing the historic oppression of African Americans through the use of hate speech.
- Given the text's intent to belittle and discriminate based on religion, the classification of hate speech is justified."

1. **Label Implication**: The classification of hate speech implies that the text contains language or sentiments that express prejudice or hostility towards a specific group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or other identity attributes.

2. **Key Features**: The phrase ""white devil"" is a key feature in this context. It carries a deeply negative and hostile connotation, suggesting that white people are inherently evil or malicious. This kind of language has historically been used to foster division and promote bigotry.

3. **Target Group Impact**: The target group mentioned is Caucasian. The tweet uses inflammatory language directed at a user who married someone Caucasian, implying that this act did not change their fundamental identity (""you will still be black"") and suggesting the marriage is doomed to fail (""when she divorces""). This promotes an us-versus-them mentality and spreads animosity based on race.

4. **Tone and Intent**: The tone of the tweet is scornful and derisive, as indicated by the use of emojis which could denote sarcasm or mocking. It appears intended to demean both the individual being addressed and their spouse, while also promoting a negative stereotype about mixed-race relationships.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the text's usage of pejorative language targeting an individual because of their partner's race, combined with historical context where such language has been used to incite hatred and division, this tweet is classified as hate speech.

This classification implies that while the statement contains potentially sensitive subject matter related to religion and immigration, it does not cross the line into hate speech or offensiveness.

Key Features:
- The term ""moslem"" is a misspelling of Muslim, which could be interpreted negatively but lacks clear intent to offend.
- The phrase ""flees an islamic country"" suggests a departure from a place due to religious affiliation, a topic that can spark debate but does not inherently promote hatred or animosity.

Target:
- Islam: The text references Muslims and Islamic countries, making the religion and its followers the primary target. However, it stops short of directly attacking or demeaning them.
- None: There is no direct attack on any specific group within the context.
- Refugee: By mentioning someone ""flees,"" there's an indirect reference to refugees, though without explicit positive or negative connotation.

Context and Tone:
- The tweet questions why leaving an Islamic country would be considered Islamophobic. This topic can be sensitive but is presented here more as food for thought rather than a clear provocation.
- There's no evident hostility or incitement in the wording, which keeps it from being classified as hate speech or even offensive.

The text raises a debatable point about perceptions of Islamophobia without employing abusive language or directly targeting individuals with malice.

While this language is not explicitly directed at any particular group or individual, it contains numerous derogatory and disrespectful terms that can be considered offensive. However, it is important to note that the use of such language does not necessarily indicate hate speech, as hate speech typically involves a clear intent to harm, threaten, or incite violence against a specific group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristic. In this case, the language appears to be more akin to venting or expressing frustration, albeit in an offensive and crass manner."

3. No specific target group is referenced, making it difficult to attribute the message to any particular demographic, further distancing it from hate speech or overtly offensive content.
4. The context implies a personal interaction and reaction to an unsent message rather than a broader, public attack on a protected characteristic or group.

In conclusion, despite expressing dislike towards an individual's actions, the tweet doesn't meet the criteria for hate speech or offensiveness due to its lack of explicit targeting and the absence of controversial key features.

Explanation: The text implies a hostile and aggressive tone towards the person who unsent a message, but it does not directly target a specific group or individual based on their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristic. While this is still not an ideal way to communicate, it falls short of meeting the criteria for hate speech as defined in the context provided.

Firstly, despite mentioning a user and alluding to a meeting with white supremacists in Montenegro, there's no clear indication of hate speech or direct offense towards any group. The tweet doesn't employ overtly prejudiced language or promote violence.

The key features are sparse, indicating that the classification is based on an absence of strongly inflammatory content rather than presence. This supports its normal categorization.

Although the tweet references white supremacists, it doesn't endorse their ideology or target a specific community with hate. It's more of a question about someone's activities, not a direct promotion or instigation of harm.

The context and tone don't suggest aggressive intent. The user appears to be seeking information rather than provoking or attacking.

However, upon closer examination, it contains a potentially problematic phrase ""honky tonk bar"". This term has been used historically in a pejorative manner to describe bars or establishments that are perceived to cater to white patrons.

Despite this, the context of its usage here seems to be more casual and less malicious. The author appears to be suggesting light-heartedly that the person they're addressing could benefit from either professional help (a therapist) or a social setting where they can relax and potentially discuss their problems (a ""honky tonk bar"").

The lack of any clear target for ridicule or malice, as well as the overall tone which seems more advisory than it is hostile, leads me to agree with the classification of this text as normal. However, the use of the term ""honky tonk"" should be approached with caution in future contexts due to its historical connotations.",21.17,"[-2.8573897  -2.13889     3.6302512  ...  8.07683    -0.37877697

The combination of these key features with the questioning of Nick Fuentes' ethnicity and gender in a negative context reinforces this classification. 

- ""Spic"" is an offensive term used to denigrate individuals of Hispanic origin, which directly targets the Hispanic community.
- The reference to ""Jew"" in a question about someone's ethnicity or background carries antisemitic undertones, targeting the Jewish group.
- The tweet also misgenders Nick Fuentes as female (""she""), potentially mocking their identity and adding a gendered dimension to the hate speech.

The user's intent seems to be to demean Nick Fuentes by questioning their ethnicity and allegiances in an inflammatory manner. By employing ethnic slurs and making baseless insinuations about religious identity, the text aims to attack both Fuentes' character and the broader groups they supposedly belong to.

In conclusion, the presence of a clear ethnic slur (""spic""), the antisemitic undertone in questioning Jewish heritage, and the misgendering of the target individual justify classifying this tweet as hate speech.

The tweet text includes the highly offensive term ""nigger"" and refers to a type of music as ""god awful nigger noise,"" clearly indicating a strong negative sentiment towards both the music and the associated culture. The use of such an extreme and inflammatory slur is a direct indicator of hate speech.

Key features like ""nigger"" and ""noise"" when combined with the context highlight a deep-seated animosity and disrespect, reinforcing the classification as hate speech. The term ""nigger"" is not only profoundly racist but also serves to dehumanize and degrade an entire community.

The target group in this case is African or African-American individuals, implied through the use of the slur and the reference to music. The intent appears to be to provoke and offend by equating a certain genre of music with ""noise"" and using one of the most severe racial slurs.

The tweet doesn't contain any features targeting a specific group negatively or perpetuating stereotypes. Additionally, there's no apparent context suggesting an implied negative connotation.

1. **Label Implication**: The label 'normal' suggests that the content is neither hate speech nor overtly offensive. It doesn't target or demean any group or individual.

2. **Key Features**: While no specific key features are identified, the phrase ""spooky szn"" and the request for money to buy ""spooky slut costumes"" could be seen as playful or tongue-in-cheek. Such language is often used in a non-literal manner, especially in the context of Halloween.

3. **Target Group**: There isn't an explicit target group mentioned in the text. The user appears to be speaking generally and possibly humorously about their interest in Halloween costumes.

4. **Context and Tone**: The tweet seems to be written in a light-hearted or joking manner, as indicated by the informal language (""szn"" instead of ""season"") and the casual request for money for costumes.

The tweet specifically targets Somali individuals and Muslim immigrants. It employs inflammatory language to suggest that their presence is a threat to Canada's population. By using terms like ""repopulate"" with negative connotations, it insinuates that the arrival of these groups would be detrimental to the country.

Additionally, the usage of the term ""moslem,"" a misspelling of ""Muslim,"" in conjunction with these other terms, suggests an intent to demean and offend based on religious identity. The reference to ""mildly retarded"" individuals adds another layer of offense by disparaging those with intellectual disabilities.

2. The direct threat of stabbing, indicating a clear intent to harm based on race.

The text's impact on the targeted group is severe, promoting violence and intimidation. The context and tone express hostility and animosity towards African individuals, with no room for misinterpretation.

Key points include the mention of ""human rights groups,"" ""politicians,"" and ""business groups"" being characterized as ""the true enemy."" Although this characterization could be seen as critical or conspiratorial in tone, it stops short of promoting violence or using overtly hostile language. The lack of specific derogatory terms targeting refugees or any other group is important to note.

The tweet expresses a view that these entities are acting against the speaker's interest by accepting refugees. While this perspective might not align with pro-refugee sentiments, it doesn't cross into hate speech territory as defined in our guidelines—it falls short of advocating violence or using clearly demeaning language towards refugees.

1. The aggressive and demeaning tone set by the repetitive usage of ""nigger"".
2. Associating members of the targeted group with negative behaviors and outcomes.
3. Suggesting a conspiracy or conflict between different subgroups, further perpetuating hostility towards African people.

The text's intent appears to provoke anger or resentment against the targeted community by painting them in an extremely negative light. This is evidenced through the inflammatory language and implied antagonistic scenarios.

The use of the term ""gaslighted"" and ""bait"" implies a manipulative or deceitful interaction, which may add to the overall offensive tone but does not necessarily indicate hate speech.

3. Absence of Target: The tweet does not seem to directly target any specific community or person negatively. It's more of a rhetorical question regarding a well-known political topic—the wall around the White House and its relation to immigration.

4. Contextual Analysis: Considering the context, the user seems to be making a sarcastic remark about the irony of an immigrant residing in the White House that was built by immigrants, and surrounded by a wall. There's no clear intent to offend or promote hatred toward any group.

The key features include the use of a derogatory term (""moslem""), reference to a gender group (men), and implication of sexual violence. These elements together create an environment of hostility.

Firstly, the term ""moslem"" is a clear misspelling aimed at insulting Muslims, which immediately sets a negative tone. Secondly, by suggesting that Muslim men might attend a women's march with the intention to sexually assault participants, the tweet demonizes and offensively stereotypes all Muslim men as potential sexual predators. This is further accentuated through the key features of ""men"" and ""sexually assaulting"".

The target groups in this context are Islam and men, specifically Muslim men, who are portrayed in a highly negative light based on their religion and gender. Despite the tweet author's disclaimer (""I hope I am wrong""), the damage has been done by introducing an alarming scenario without any evidence.

In conclusion, this tweet is classified as ""offensive"" due to its use of a pejorative term for Muslims, the unjust stereotyping of Muslim men, and the suggestion of a serious crime with no substantiation.

Though it discusses a negative interaction involving identity-based judgments, the tweet doesn't appear to encourage animosity or express hate toward straight white people or sketch instructors. It seems more focused on sharing an ironic ""happy tuesday"" grievance with fellow marginalized comedy enthusiasts.

In summary, despite touching on sensitive social issues, this text lacks the clear intent to promote harm, hostility, or superiority towards any group based on identity that would qualify it as hate speech or even clearly offensive.

- The tweet expresses an opinion on the relevance of a religious ideology in modern times without using hate speech or targeting specific individuals. 
- There is no call to action against Muslims or Arabs, just a critique of the religion's origins and applicability today.

2. **Racial Preference**: Advocating for a political party that champions white rights over others implies a belief in white supremacy which inherently devalues other ethnicities or races.

3. **Exclusionary Ideology**: The text suggests a preference for English-speaking immigrants based on religion and race, specifically favoring ""white Christian Europeans"" over those of other backgrounds. This reflects an us-versus-them mentality that fosters division and animosity towards the targeted groups.

4. **Contextual Aggression**: Mentioning that Britain ""is crying out for a pro-white political party"" frames the issue as urgent and justifies the need for such exclusionary politics, potentially inciting aggressive actions or sentiments among like-minded individuals.

The key features, such as the word ""kike,"" which is an egregious slur against Jewish people, demonstrate a clear intent to offend and promote animosity. Moreover, the context of banning a favored YouTube channel adds a layer of grievance that exacerbates the hate-filled tone.

The target of this hate speech is unequivocally the Jewish community, as evidenced by the use of anti-Semitic slurs. The language used goes beyond mere offensiveness; it conveys a deep-seated bigotry and hostility, which is why this text falls squarely into the category of hate speech.

The tone is aggressive and exclusionary, expressing a clear intent to denigrate and marginalize the target group based on race. The reference to ""blood stream"" implies a biological or genetic basis for this hatred, further intensifying its bigoted nature.

Given the context of the slur ""kike"" and the inflammatory historical references, it is clear that the intent was to provoke and offend the target group with false equivalencies and incendiary language.

3. This creates an environment of hostility and division by implying that the justice system is biased along racial lines.

3. Target: The text targets ""white people"" and ""Africans,"" discussing their legal status on different continents. However, the tone is more questioning and provocative rather than directly hostile or aggressive.

3. The tweet specifically targets Islam by associating a follower of the religion with incompetence in a position of authority, potentially perpetuating negative stereotypes about Muslims in general and Muslim law enforcement officers specifically.

  - tweet_text: ""gotta get you a real bitch a bad bitch ain t nothing but a bill""
  - While the language used in this tweet is colloquial and contains potentially inflammatory terms such as ""bitch"", it lacks specific context or targeted groups that would categorize it as hate speech or overtly offensive. The phrase ""ain't nothing but a bill"" suggests a casual, idiomatic expression rather than a directed insult.
  - This classification hinges on the absence of clear malicious intent or specific targeting. The tweet seems to be using slang in a general sense without apparent harm toward any particular individual or group.
  - Without additional context indicating an intent to demean or attack based on protected characteristics like race, gender, etc., this falls short of qualifying as hate speech or even clearly offensive.
  - Therefore, despite the coarse language, it is most appropriately labeled as neutral due to insufficient evidence of bigotry or aggression toward a target group.

The reference to ""zionist"" and the slur ""kike"" leaves no doubt about the intended target. The user's intent seems to be inciting hate and promoting conspiracy theories linking Jewish people with Satanism. This is reinforced by the sweeping generalization that all members of the group are identical in their supposed evil nature.

1. **Implication of Label**: The label 'normal' indicates that the text does not contain overtly hostile or aggressive content and is part of a broader discussion or debate.
   
2. **Key Features**: Though there are no specific key features highlighted, the mention of ""grc"" (presumably referring to Gender Recognition Certificates), ""prisons"", and ""changing rooms"" suggests that this is a text discussing complex social issues related to transgender rights and public safety. The absence of overtly inflammatory or abusive language supports its classification as normal.

3. **Target Group**: While the text references sensitive topics concerning trans individuals, women, and girls, it does not directly target any group with hate speech or explicit offense. Rather, it poses a question about finding solutions to a perceived problem.

4. **Context and Tone**: The tone of the text is inquisitive, seeking an answer to a challenging issue rather than promoting hostility or aggression towards any specific community. It raises concerns that some may consider valid for discussion within a broader social context.

2. The phrase ""going to get fucked by the left"" implies violence or harm from a political faction, enhancing the threat's severity.
3. Mentioning Trump's son-in-law as part of the blame amplifies the antisemitic sentiment by specifically targeting a Jewish individual close to power.

While the text may also be criticizing the removal of historical portraits and their replacement with diverse art, the choice of language reveals a prejudiced perspective aimed at insulting the individual involved and her identity."

The phrase ""towel head"" is a racial slur that mocks traditional headwear used in these cultures, reducing them to objects of ridicule. The addition of ""ass"" further demeans and insults the target group.

This classification is supported by:

1. **Derogatory Language**: The term ""towel head"" is an ethnic slur used to demean individuals based on their cultural attire.
2. **Dehumanizing Tone**: The phrase reduces a human being to an object (""head"") and adds an animalistic insult (""ass""), stripping away dignity.
3. **Clear Targeting**: Though not explicitly stated, the reference to ""towel head"" points to Arab or Indian individuals who wear traditional head coverings.

Key Features Supporting Classification:
- Mention of book titles and author names indicating a promotional nature.
- No explicit hate language or direct targeting of groups.
- The phrase 'badly behaved women' is part of a book title, not an attack on any specific person or group.

Impact on Target Group:
- The target appears to be potential readers interested in African literature. There's no evident intent to offend or provoke any specific demographic.

Context and Tone Assessment:
- Contextually, the tweet seems to aim at generating interest in the mentioned books.
- The tone is casual and promotional rather than hostile or aggressive.

The tweet lists names of individuals followed by their descriptors - some are identified as ""negroes"" which, although an outdated term, doesn't inherently express hate in this context. Crucially, there's no language used here that directly demeans, abuses, or promotes violence against any group.

The key feature is the historical nature of the narrative. It seems to be recounting past events involving specific individuals. The mention of a lynching and injuries indicates it might be detailing violent incidents from history, but there's no commentary or language used that advocates for or glorifies such violence.

The text doesn't appear to have an intended target in the sense of inciting harm or offense. It reads more like a factual account naming involved parties. 

Considering context and tone, it seems to be sharing a historical event involving named persons and incidents of violence from the past. The language is descriptive rather than inflammatory or prejudiced.

In conclusion, while the text contains references to violent historical acts and uses an outdated term for African Americans, the lack of abusive or bigoted language toward any group, coupled with its seemingly informative tone, justifies its classification as normal rather than hate speech or even offensive. It appears aimed at documenting past events without promoting the ideologies that incited the original violence.",31.98,[ 3.3400435  2.7100003 -1.921151  ...  8.141818   1.4331819  3.86074  ],1," normal

Explanation: The text appears to be discussing historical events, specifically lynchings of African Americans and a shooting involving a white man. While the use of the term ""negroes"" could be considered offensive, it is important to consider the historical context in which this term was commonly used at the time. Additionally, there are no explicit or implied threats or expressions of contempt towards any specific group based on their race. Therefore, the text should be classified as normal."

1. The label 'normal' suggests that the content doesn't actively promote hatred or direct offense towards any group.

2. Key features are missing from your input, which implies no explicit terms or phrases were used that would classify this text as hate speech or overtly offensive. 

3. While there is a reference to ""antifa description of evil racist hateful and highly homophobic white men"", it's presented more in the context of political commentary rather than active promotion of these characteristics.

4. The historical discussion regarding U.S involvement in WW2 and the attack by Japan doesn't contain language or tone that could be considered inflammatory or directly targeting a group negatively.

1. The label's implication: The text contains language that could be perceived as aggressive and confrontational towards a specific group (in this case, white people). This moves it away from being classified as neutral.

2. Key features supporting classification: 
   - The phrase ""racist white people"" is an explicit generalization targeting a racial group in a negative context.
   - The use of the term ""trope"" implies a dismissive and prejudiced view towards the actions or beliefs of others.
   
3. Impact on or reference to target group:
    - White individuals are directly targeted with accusations of racism without specific evidence, promoting a broad-brush negative stereotype.

4. Context and tone assessment:
   - The text uses an accusatory and combative tone which contributes to its classification as offensive rather than neutral or hate speech.
   
5. Conclusion justifying the classification: 
   - Although it does not contain explicit slurs or promote violence, the tweet's aggressive generalizations towards a group based on race make it fall into the ""offensive"" category. The lack of specific context or evidence for these accusations further supports this classification.

The text could potentially be seen as hate speech due to its broad-brush negative stereotype and accusatory tone targeting white people.

The context and tone of the tweet indicate an intent to demean and marginalize Jewish people through the use of inflammatory language. This kind of targeted vitriol has no place in civil discourse and serves only to incite hatred and division.

Although the phrase ""black ass Baltimore"" may raise eyebrows, it lacks clear indicators of malicious intent or targeted offense towards any group.

In this context, ""Baltimore"" refers to the city and ""all white"" likely describes the audience demographic. The term ""black ass"", while potentially vulgar, seems more colloquial here without explicit racist connotations given the lack of other derogatory terms or negative sentiment.

The neutral classification stems from this reading - an account of an experience that happens to involve a predominantly white crowd for a black performer in Baltimore. While crude phrasing could be off-putting to some, it does not cross into hate speech or direct offense when viewed charitably as casual slang.

In summary, the text gets categorized as normal due to its personal narrative nature and absence of clear bigotry or inflammatory language attacking any group.

The key feature supporting this classification is the usage of ""hoes"", which demeans women by equating them to prostitutes and implies promiscuity or moral laxity. This term contributes significantly to the offense caused, as it perpetuates negative stereotypes about women's character based on their presumed sexual behavior.

The tweet directly targets women, employing a gendered slur that carries historical weight in demeaning and devaluing this group. The context suggests a dismissive attitude towards women, further reinforcing the offensiveness of the statement.

- The tweet text contains the term ""bitch,"" which is a gendered slur often used to demean women. This contributes significantly to its classification as offensive.
  
- While the message ostensibly offers a caution about personal safety, the choice of language undercuts any well-meaning intent and serves mainly to insult and intimidate.

- Given the absence of specific context, the tweet appears to target women in general with this threatening language, which could make them feel unsafe or belittled.

- The abrasive tone and use of a gendered slur without clear provocation justify classifying this as offensive rather than neutral or merely critical.

- The classification is driven by the presence of the demeaning phrase ""his white ass"".
- This language choice fosters negative stereotypes and promotes division based on race.

This term's inclusion in the context of a competition among women, where the author revokes someone's eligibility based on this new detail, suggests a negative stereotyping and bias against individuals of African origin.

Explanation: The statement ""it's okay to be white"" is often used as a counter-protest to assert that being white is not inherently problematic or something to be ashamed of. In this context, it doesn't contain explicit hate speech against any specific group and can be considered neutral or normal, even if some might find it controversial or offensive due to its historical associations with far-right groups.

It's essential to acknowledge that the same phrase can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. While some may use it as a harmless assertion of personal identity, others might interpret it as an expression of white supremacist ideologies or a way to deny systemic racism and oppression faced by marginalized communities.

However, without further context or additional information about the user's intent or tone, it's impossible to definitively classify this statement as hate speech, offensive, or normal with absolute certainty. The given examples serve as guidelines but do not necessarily apply directly to this situation."

- **Key Features**: The use of the term ""nigger"" is a key feature that categorizes this text as hate speech. This term is an extreme racial slur used to target and demean individuals of African descent.

- **Impact on Target Group**: The text directly targets individuals of African descent by using highly offensive language, creating a hostile environment that perpetuates historical injustices and contemporary prejudices against the group.

- **Context and Tone**: The context trivializes the harm caused by such language, equating it with a comment about fashion choices. The tone is aggressive and demeaning, showing clear contempt for the target group.

- The tweet text contains generalizations about various groups but lacks explicit hate speech or severe offensiveness. 
- While phrases like ""men are trash"" and ""white people racist"" could be considered provocative, they are not used with extreme malice or in a highly targeted manner.
- The statement ""when you know literally <percent> of the world"" suggests the user is criticizing overgeneralizations rather than endorsing them.

- No identifiable targets: There are no apparent references to specific groups or individuals that would suggest hate speech or offensiveness.
- Lack of context: Without additional information about the situation or topic being discussed, it's challenging to determine intent.

1. Label Implication: The term ""offensive"" suggests that the language used in the tweet is likely to cause offense or distress to certain groups or individuals.
   
2. Key Features Justification:
   - ""spik"": This term appears to be a misspelled version of an ethnic slur directed at Hispanic people, indicating a clear intent to offend.
   - ""jewed"": The term suggests deceitful behavior stereotypically associated with Jewish people, contributing to the tweet's offensiveness by perpetuating negative stereotypes.
   - ""up"": This phrase completes the previous term to imply that Ted Cruz was in some way compromised or corrupted (""jewed up""), furthering the offense.

3. Target Impact:
   - The tweet explicitly targets two groups: Hispanic individuals through the use of a slur, and Jewish individuals via an antisemitic trope. These references serve no purpose other than to demean and insult these communities.
   
4. Context and Tone Assessment:
   - The overall tone of the tweet is hostile and derisive. This context amplifies the offensiveness by showing clear animosity towards the targeted groups.

5. Conclusion:
  - By using derogatory slurs and negative stereotypes directly targeting Hispanic and Jewish people, while expressing a hostile sentiment, this tweet is conclusively classified as offensive.

- Referring to the mentioned individuals as ""actors"" and stating they are Jewish implies a conspiracy theory, further contributing to the hate speech.
- The phrase ""just a spic"" dehumanizes the individual being referred to.

Target:
- The text targets both the Hispanic community through the use of the slur ""spic,"" and the Jewish community by baselessly accusing them of involvement in a purported scheme.

Tone and Intent:
- The tone is hostile and accusatory, demonstrating clear intent to demean and spread animosity towards these groups.

In this case, the term ""kike"" is a highly offensive slur targeting Jewish people, implying they are inferior or unworthy.

2. **Key Features**: The word ""kike"" is an antisemitic slur that has historically been used to dehumanize and persecute Jewish individuals. The phrase ""needs to be baptised"" suggests a forced conversion from Judaism, which is deeply disrespectful and dismissive of Jewish religious beliefs.

3. **Impact on Target Group**: This text directly targets the Jewish community by using a term intended to demean them and suggesting they need to abandon their faith. Such language can promote an environment of hostility and exclusion towards this group.

4. **Context and Tone**: The tone is aggressive and intolerant, indicating a desire to impose one's religious beliefs on others through coercive means. This kind of statement fuels animosity and division rather than fostering understanding or respect.

2. Key features: The term ""hoe"" is central to this classification as it derisively targets women.
  
3. Impact on target group: Women are targeted by the pejorative language, which can contribute to negative stereotypes and an unwelcoming atmosphere.

   - False claim about refugees being involved in a ""gang rape"", which taps into xenophobic fears and prejudices.

3. **Impact on Target Group**: The text targets Muslim refugees, promoting a false and damaging stereotype that they pose a threat to society, specifically through acts of sexual violence. This can incite hatred or fear against this group.

Although it discusses representation in entertainment and critiques certain performances, these points are presented matter-of-factly without direct attacks or pejorative terms targeting any group.

Key Features:
- Mention of ""white women"" and their performances is not inherently negative; rather, it serves to highlight the need for more diverse representation.
- The invitation to participate in burlesque and drag suggests inclusiveness and a desire for broader engagement across different demographics.

Target Group:
The text specifically mentions ""white women,"" but this reference does not carry a tone of hostility or derision. Instead, it's used within a larger observation about the entertainment industry's need for more diverse representation.

Intent Analysis:
The user seems to express a view on representation in performance arts, advocating for greater diversity and opportunities for different groups. The overall tone is one of mild critique rather than aggression or offense.

Conclusion:
This text's classification as neutral rests on its measured critique of a cultural issue and an invitation for wider participation without employing hostile language or targeting any group negatively.

Without further context, it's challenging to ascertain if there's an intent to offend or demean based solely on this phrase.

However, the mention of ""punches"" could potentially suggest a violent action towards the individual's own self or others, but without explicit indicators that it targets the homosexual community in a negative way, classifying it as neutral is reasonable. The term ""small gay ass"" lacks an aggressive or pejorative connotation typically associated with hate speech or highly offensive language.

   - The addition of terms like ""fuck"" and ""bitch"", further intensifying the negativity towards the targeted individual, who appears to be a woman.

3. Impact on or reference to the target group:
   - This text specifically targets two groups: Jewish individuals through the use of ""kike"", and women via the term ""bitch"". The combination of these slurs in one statement amplifies the offense.

   - The context appears to be an expression of extreme dislike or anger towards a specific individual, identified by her ethnicity and gender.
   - The tone is highly aggressive and abusive, indicating clear animosity.

1. The label 'normal' implies that the content of the tweet does not contain elements of hate speech or overt offensiveness.

5. Considering the context, tone, and absence of overtly problematic features, the tweet seems to express the author's excitement about visiting Paris and their desire to enjoy a familiar beverage there.

Here's why:

1. **Label Implication**: Hate speech refers to language that expresses prejudice or promotes hatred towards a particular group, often based on race, religion, or sexual orientation.

2. **Key Features**:
   - The mention of ""black moslem serial killer"" and ""gays"" in the same sentence creates a prejudiced association between these groups.
   - The use of the term ""moslem"" instead of ""Muslim"" carries a negative connotation.
   - The contrast made with the ""lesbian waitress"" incident insinuates a bias in media coverage, suggesting that one group's suffering is given more importance than another's.

3. **Target Group Impact**:
   - The text targets multiple groups: African Americans, Muslims, and the LGBTQ+ community. It perpetuates negative stereotypes about these communities by linking them to criminal acts and suggesting they receive preferential treatment in media coverage.

4. **Context and Tone**: 
   - The tone is critical and conspiratorial, implying a hidden agenda behind media reporting.
   - The context of comparing the coverage of two incidents with very different impacts (a serial killer vs. a waitress receiving a bad tip) trivializes the seriousness of both situations.

5. **Conclusion**:
    - This text promotes negative stereotypes about African Americans, Muslims, and the LGBTQ+ community by implying that their criminal acts are overlooked or downplayed by the media.

- The acknowledgement of wrongdoing (""i feel really bad for calling you a dyke"") suggests remorse rather than malice.
- Baking cookies is a conciliatory act that indicates goodwill.

The tweet references the homosexual community as its target but does so in a personal, non-generalized manner. Additionally, it's clear there's no intent to promote hatred or harm; rather, it aims to make amends for a previous offense.

Explanation: Although the user attempts to apology and expresses good intentions through the gesture of baking cookies, the initial derogatory term ""dyke"" used towards another person remains an offensive action. Apologies cannot always undo the harm caused by hate speech, especially when it targets a marginalized community. It is essential to recognize the impact of language and acknowledge that even seemingly lighthearted usage of derogatory terms can contribute to perpetuating negative stereotypes and creating a hostile environment. In this case, the situation should be classified as ""offensive."""

The tweet text contains multiple key features that support its classification as hate speech. These include the use of highly derogatory terms such as ""nigger apes"" and ""race traitor,"" which are explicitly used to target and demean individuals based on race. The phrase ""gang banged"" suggests sexual violence, adding an additional layer of aggression and offensiveness.

The intended target of this text is clear: African people. The language used is not only racially charged but also promotes violence (""a war is coming""), contributing to a hostile and threatening tone. This combination of racial slurs, the promotion of sexual assault, and the call for violence unequivocally categorizes this as hate speech.

In conclusion, the tweet's usage of inflammatory and aggressive language targeting African people, along with its advocacy for violence, justifies its classification as hate speech.",21.04,"[ 1.8747315   1.733018    1.796475   ... 11.445346   -7.929241

The combination of these elements creates a highly hostile and demeaning environment that incites harm against specific groups based on their race, gender, or perceived loyalty.

- The tweet text mentions concerns about the ""stand your ground law"" and its potential implications. However, it lacks specific details or context to identify any hate speech or overtly offensive language.
  
- Key features are not explicitly provided, indicating that the text itself may not contain clear indicators of hate speech or offensiveness.

- The absence of a clearly defined target group suggests the statement is more of a general expression of concern rather than a targeted attack.

- Although the word ""bitch"" could be considered potentially offensive, its usage here seems to be in a general sense without a specific target. This, combined with the lack of other derogatory or hate-filled language, leads to its classification as normal.

The text doesn't advocate for prejudice or hostility against any group but seems to be recounting an incident in which someone else may have used these terms inappropriately, with the author perhaps expressing disapproval by pointing out the escalation of the conflict.

3. Without further context, the tweet appears to be a casual banter or jest rather than an act of hostility.

- The tweet uses the highly inflammatory and racially charged term ""niggers"" multiple times, targeting African individuals. This language is overtly hostile and degrading.
  
- The key features include explicit sexual terms combined with the repeated use of a severe racial slur. These elements work together to create an extremely insulting and demeaning statement directed at African people.

- By instructing this group to ""get all excited"" because ""she sucks dick you hardly e dr get that without niggers in presence"", the tweet denigrates them through crude sexual content while suggesting they are only useful for menial or degrading tasks. 

- The tone is aggressive, vulgar, and dismissive of African people's humanity and dignity. The intent appears to be to offend, intimidate, and assert superiority over the targeted group through shocking and abusive language.

The tweet's hostile tone and its unprovoked verbal attack on a specific group based on their ethnicity make it clear that the user's intent is to incite hatred or violence. The aggressive command ""shut up"" followed by a derogatory term highlights a strong desire to silence and demean the target, reinforcing the classification of hate speech.

However, there are elements that could potentially be seen as insensitive or trivializing violent events:

- Comparing body counts and ammunition used between different attacks in a matter of fact way.
- Referring to victims as ""bernie bro"" which diminishes their loss of life.

3. The text also uses phrases like ""dropped some redpills,"" which is an alt-right term referring to converting others to far-right ideologies, and ""hail victory comrades,"" echoing Nazi salutes. These terms signal the promotion of extreme right-wing views that often include hate against specific ethnic or religious groups.

4. The context appears to involve a social gathering in a rural setting where the absence of people from the targeted ethnic backgrounds is celebrated. This underscores an environment of exclusion and intolerance based on race.

The user's intent appears to be provocative and insulting, utilizing the slur in a context that attempts to diminish the accomplishments of Leonardo da Vinci by falsely associating him with a fabricated identity. This not only demonstrates disrespect towards da Vinci but also employs inflammatory language to insult African people, suggesting they are somehow lesser or unworthy of historical achievements.

The combination of the slur's extreme offensiveness and its use in undermining both an ethnic group and a renowned historical figure confirms this text as hate speech. The reference to a debunked conspiracy theory regarding cell phones further indicates the user's intent to spread misinformation and provoke outrage.

1. The use of the term ""dykes"" is a derogatory slang for homosexual women, which can be deeply offensive.
2. The words ""nigga"" and ""bitches"" are both highly inflammatory slurs targeting African-Americans and women respectively, adding to the offensiveness.
3. The word ""retarded"" is an ableist term used pejoratively.

The key features in this tweet consist of several pejorative terms that target multiple groups: homosexual women, African-Americans, and individuals with intellectual disabilities. This combination of targeted slurs creates a highly hostile and derogatory tone, indicating clear intent to offend and demean the referenced groups.

In conclusion, given the use of strong slurs and the direct targeting of marginalized communities in a negative context, this tweet is unequivocally classified as **Offensive**.",18.52,[-1.6256655  2.7144554  2.2071087 ... 10.248759  -3.8656216  0.9181099],2, hate speech

This slur directly targets African people, implying they are unwanted and unwelcome in the context of space exploration. The key features such as ""where no niggers are invited nor wanted"" and ""it a nigger free space"" emphasize this classification by explicitly excluding an entire race from the imagined future of space travel.

The language used is highly inflammatory and serves no purpose other than to denigrate and marginalize African people. By contrasting the aspirational theme of exploring new worlds with the exclusionary sentiment towards Africans, it perpetuates a message of white supremacy and black inferiority.

In conclusion, the text's utilization of extreme racial slurs in conjunction with its clear intent to demean and ostracize African individuals solidifies its categorization as hate speech.

This classification is based on the following analysis:

1. **Label Implication**: The label 'normal' suggests that the text does not contain elements of hate speech or offense. It implies that the content is neutral and unlikely to cause harm or discomfort.

2. **Key Features Analysis**: There are no key features identified in the tweet that would suggest hate speech or offensiveness. While ""queer"" can sometimes be used pejoratively, here it appears to be part of a fantastical game scenario involving a horned character and bunnies, not targeting homosexual individuals negatively.

3. **Target Group Impact**: The reference groups identified are 'Homosexual' and 'None'. The word 'queer' is used in the context of a game setting rather than as an insult towards homosexuals. Thus, it doesn't seem to target or disparage any group based on sexual orientation.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**: The tweet seems to be describing a scenario from a roguelike game that involves fantastical creatures like a horned character and bunnies. The context is playful rather than malicious, and the tone does not convey any intent to offend or promote hate.

5. **Conclusion Justification**: Based on the lack of key offending features, the neutral and playful context, and the absence of clear targeting towards a group with negative connotations, the classification of 'normal' is justified. The tweet appears to be an innocent description of a game scenario rather than a vehicle for hate speech or offense.",40.01,[ 4.9163857  2.7278712 -1.0719507 ...  8.527109  -5.257301   5.3835917],1, normal

Although not directly targeting a group in a hostile manner, the phrase ""get you a nigga"" employs a derogatory term that objectifies and perpetuates stereotypes about black individuals. The term ""wam wam"", referring to easy money or ""walk around money"", further contributes to a tone of casual disrespect.

Additionally, the instruction to ""stop fucking with the local jokers"" uses aggressive language in dismissing others as insignificant, which could be seen as demeaning. 

While not explicitly categorized as hate speech or blatantly targeting a specific group with hostility, the casual usage of these terms and the overall dismissive and objectifying tone suggests that this text warrants classification as at least mildly offensive rather than strictly normal.

In summary, despite its apparent lack of direct malice towards any particular group, the language used in this text could contribute to an environment of casual disrespect and normalization of problematic slang.

However, without more context it's hard to definitively classify this as hate speech. The usage of crude sexual terms in reference to an unnamed woman suggests an intent to demean rather than engage in substantive discussion.

The key features supporting a more severe classification are the use of ""bad bitch"" and sexual language, which some may find deeply offensive or dehumanizing towards women. The target appears to be women in general.

However, there is not enough context to determine if this is intended as an attack on all women or a specific individual. It also lacks overt calls to violence or other trademarks of hate speech. More information would be needed to conclusively label it as such.

Ultimately, while the language used is crude and degrading towards women, the lack of clear intent to promote hatred or attacks based solely on gender puts this in more of an offensive category than outright hate speech at this point. But the line between very strong misogyny and hate speech can be blurry here without additional context to make a definitive classification either way.

In conclusion, while containing highly problematic language degrading women, more context is needed to determine if this rises to the level of gender-based hate speech or remains an isolated instance of extremely misogynistic and crude rhetoric. For now it leans towards being categorized as very strongly offensive due to the sexual terminology and use of a gendered slur.",32.96,[ 4.7015414  1.0160456  2.2315528 ... 10.593902  -4.323225   3.6445155],1," offensive.

This term contributes significantly to the text's hostile and demeaning tone towards people of Hispanic descent.

The key feature that supports this classification is the word ""spic"" itself, an abbreviated form of another offensive slur. Its inclusion in the context of discussing someone's family composition reveals the user's intent to belittle and degrade based on ethnicity.

Although no specific individual or group is directly targeted by name, the tweet makes a clear reference to Hispanic people in general. The casual use of this term within a seemingly humorous context does not mitigate its hurtful impact but rather normalizes the usage of such language.

In conclusion, the presence of an ethnic slur and the implied negativity towards individuals based on their ethnicity provides ample justification for classifying this text as hate speech.

- The conspiratorial claim about devils using the holocaust for world conquest, which fuels anti-Semitic tropes.

The target groups affected by this hate speech are Caucasian and Jewish communities. The text denies their identity and accuses them of malevolent intentions, reinforcing dangerous stereotypes.

The tone is hostile and lacks any empathy towards the plight of these refugees. By using dehumanizing language and advocating for forced removal, the text promotes animosity and fear against this community.

Key factors:
- The clarification that the original speaker did not say ""I wish you would walk in rape survivor shoes"" but rather ""I hope you get raped,"" with an acknowledgement of poor wording.
- This explanation attempts to clear up a potential misunderstanding and acknowledge the offensiveness of the original statement.

The text's reference to such a sensitive topic could potentially be viewed as offensive, but given that it appears to be a clarification or correction of another's words, rather than expressing a personal sentiment, it leans more towards neutral. The user is not promoting violence or making light of the issue, but rather seems to be engaging in discussion about the impact of certain phrasings.

The classification is normal due to:

- Attempt at clarification/correction rather than endorsement of the referenced statement
- Absence of explicit targeting or derision towards any individual or group

The tweet directly targets homosexuals with the derogatory term ""faggots"". This explicit, hostile language is a clear marker of hate speech. The context implies an ongoing conflict or prejudice against this group.

Key features:
- Usage of the slur ""faggots"" - a homophobic term used to demean and insult individuals based on their sexual orientation.
  
The tweet's tone is aggressive and confrontational, indicating an intent to harm or incite hostility towards homosexuals. This is reinforced by the accusatory phrasing ""you all always coming for"".

Key points supporting this classification:
1. The phrase ""mah waifu"" is an informal, meme-derived term used to humorously refer to someone's favorite character, often in anime. Its usage here suggests a lighthearted, joking tone rather than malicious intent.
2. There are no explicitly demeaning or aggressive phrases targeting the individual mentioned or white people generally.

While the text could be seen as mildly edging on sensitive topics like race and relationships, its casual style and ambiguity make it difficult to classify as intentionally hostile or bigoted. The user seems more interested in humorous self-deprecation than promoting hate or prejudice against a group.

- References to ""fanarts"" and ""threads"" about Todd and Hank suggest fictional shipping scenarios, which, while possibly distasteful to the user, do not inherently contain hate speech or directly offend a group.

The tweet seems to be an exaggerated expression of frustration towards online fan culture rather than an attack on specific individuals or groups. The context is informal and personal, focusing on the author's subjective experience in their dream.

This language not only dehumanizes and vilifies Muslim individuals but also promotes violence against them, as seen in phrases like ""white genocide"" and ""islamo facism."" The intent appears to be inciting hatred and hostility towards the Islamic community.

Additionally, the inclusion of numeric code terms such as ""14 words"" suggests an affiliation with white supremacist ideology.

1. The label's implication: Hate speech involves language that expresses prejudice or promotes hatred against a specific group, often based on race, religion, or ethnicity.

2. Key features supporting this classification:
   - The term ""kike"" is an ethnic slur used to target Jewish people. Its inclusion in the text indicates clear prejudice and animosity towards the targeted group.
   - The phrase ""these kike lovers"" compounds the offense by implying that those who associate with or support Jewish individuals are also targets of disdain.

3. Impact on or reference to the target group:
   - The language used explicitly attacks Jewish people and their supporters, promoting a hostile environment that encourages prejudice and potential physical violence (as suggested by ""punching right"").

4. Context and tone assessment:
   - The aggressive tone, coupled with profanity (""fuckin"") and the command to ""keep their fuckin mouths shut"", reveals an intent to intimidate and silence the target group.
   
5. Justification for classification:

This term carries a long history of being used to demean and degrade individuals of African descent. 

The key features that support this classification include not only the term itself but also the context in which it's used. The phrase ""nigger genes"" implies an attempt to dehumanize African people by reducing them to mere genetic material, stripped of humanity and dignity. This reflects a broader pattern often seen in hate speech where targeted groups are portrayed as less than human.

The tweet specifically targets individuals who believe that race isn't real, suggesting they're foolish for not recognizing the supposed superiority or inferiority of different races. By mocking these beliefs through the lens of such potent language, the tweet aims to undermine any stance that challenges its prejudiced worldview.

Considering the tone and context, it's clear that the user intends to incite laughter at the expense of both African people and those who challenge racism. This indicates a deep-seated contempt for both groups, illustrating the intent behind the post.

In conclusion, the tweet is classified as hate speech due to its use of explicitly derogatory language targeting individuals of African descent and those opposing racism.

- This slur directly targets individuals of Jewish faith or heritage, promoting bigotry and hostility towards this group.

Tone and Intent:

- Positive reaction: The tweet mentions that the target group finds the speaker's manner of speaking ""cool,"" indicating no offense or harm intended.

- The presence of the derogatory slur ""nigger"", which is a blatant expression of bigotry.

Key features supporting the hate speech classification include:
- Usage of the slur ""spic"" which is a derogatory term targeting individuals of Hispanic descent.
- The phrase ""be deported"" directly advocates for the exclusion and removal of an individual based on their ethnicity.

   - Although mentioning race and immigration, it does so in a descriptive manner without resorting to overtly negative language.
   
3. Impact on target group:
   - While the text discusses race and immigration, it's more of an observation on social dynamics rather than a direct attack or insult against any particular group.

2. Without additional context, the emojis (tears of joy) suggest a playful or sarcastic tone, which contradicts the literal interpretation of hate or offense. 

3. The lack of identifiable targets or key features associated with hate speech or direct offensiveness supports its neutral classification.

- It sarcastically suggests these celebrities should be appointed as ambassadors to ""war-torn moslem countries.""
- The reference to ""exactly how ambassador stevens died"" insinuates that these celebrities should face life-threatening situations.

The tweet's intended target appears to be liberal celebrities who opposed Trump's presidency. By suggesting they become ambassadors to dangerous regions, the user is not only mocking their political views but also trivializing the severity of war zones and the death of an ambassador.

The tone is sarcastic and hostile, intending to belittle and punish specific individuals for their past statements. This goes beyond mere disagreement into the realm of personal attack, making it offensive.

The tweet references a purported incident involving a girl having her hair cut off by white boys at a school where Pence's wife works.

Key points:
1. The tweet does not contain explicit hate speech or direct targeting of any group.
2. While critical of media outlets and implying political bias, the language used is not egregiously inflammatory or personally attacking.
3. No clear evidence of deliberate offense or promotion of hatred against a protected group based on race, religion, ethnicity etc.

1. The label 'normal' suggests that while the content may contain some aggressive language, it does not cross the line into hate speech or highly offensive territory.
2. Key features: Despite mentioning a gun and potential violence towards ""hoes"", no specific group is targeted. This prevents it from being classified as hate speech which typically involves targeting protected classes or groups.
3. Impact on target: The lack of a clearly defined target group means the text doesn't contain direct attacks or incitement against any specific individuals or communities. 
4. Context and tone: The aggressive tone could be interpreted as posturing rather than genuine intent to harm. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine if this is serious or idle threats.
5. Conclusion: While the language is coarse and violent in nature, absent explicit targeting of protected groups or clear incitement to real-world violence, it avoids being classified as hate speech or highly offensive.

This phrase contributes to a negative stereotype and targets individuals based on their religious beliefs.

Key features supporting this classification:
- The use of ""muzzie"" specifically demeans members of the Muslim community.
- Associating a violent act with an individual from the targeted group reinforces negative stereotypes.

The tweet's target, Arab, Islam, Jewish communities, is clear through the choice of words and the reference to a violent incident involving a sword near Buckingham Palace. The user's intent appears to be stoking fear or animosity towards these groups by suggesting that Uber drivers pose a potential threat due to their religious beliefs.

The tweet employs the term ""shitskin,"" a pejorative with racial undertones. It's directed at Indians in an attempt to demean based on ethnicity, hence the classification.

Key features supporting this include:
- The usage of ""shitskin,"" which is a slur against people of Indian descent.
- ""Tier"" here is used to intensify the insult by ranking the individual's sadness as extremely pathetic.

The target appears to be Indian individuals, and the term used contributes to an environment of hostility. 

Considering the context and tone - it is dismissive and mocking, meant to belittle the recipient based on their perceived ethnicity. This justifies its classification as ""offensive"" due to its use of a specific ethnic slur in a demeaning manner.

However, upon analysis, the following points emerge:

1. **Implications of Normal Classification**: The normal classification suggests that the text does not overtly contain hate speech or highly offensive content. Yet, it's crucial to examine the language and context more closely.

2. **Key Features Supporting Re-Classification**:
   - ""call me a nigger lover shitskin apologist and misogynist"": These phrases indicate self-identification with derogatory terms often used in hate speech. The terms 'nigger', 'shitskin', and 'misogynist' are highly charged and typically associated with prejudice.
   - ""general powell was duped by white people"": This implies a conspiracy theory involving race, which could be inflammatory.
   - ""hillary did it for power and blood sport only nimrata randhawa rabbi knows her motivations"": The reference to a political figure engaging in manipulative behavior, along with the mention of 'nimrata randhawa rabbi', introduces an element of conspiracy or targeted accusation.

3. **Impact on Target Groups**:
   - African: Use of the term ""nigger"" directly targets and offends this group.
   - Caucasian: While not directly offended, the text implies a negative action by ""white people"".
   - Other: The reference to 'nimrata randhawa rabbi' could be seen as targeting religious or ethnic groups.

4. **Context and Tone**:
   - The tone is accusatory and conspiratorial. It uses inflammatory language suggesting bigotry ('nigger lover', 'shitskin apologist') and misogyny.
   
5. **Conclusion**: 
Upon closer examination, the text contains several elements of hate speech (use of slurs) and potentially promotes conspiracy theories targeting specific groups.

4. The tone of the text seems more reflective and observational rather than malicious or intending harm, which supports its classification as normal.

This classification is based on the following analysis:

1. The label 'normal' implies that the text does not contain any elements of hate speech or overt offensiveness. In this case, the user expresses a desire to have watched the show ""Queer Eye"" sooner due to their current obsession with it.

2. There are no key features in the tweet that suggest hate speech or offensiveness. The language used is casual and expressive, but does not target any group or individual negatively.

3. As the tweet does not mention or allude to any specific target beyond the show ""Queer Eye"", there is no discernible impact on a particular audience or reference to a targeted group.

4. The context of the tweet seems to be one of self-reflection and mild frustration that the user didn't start watching the show earlier, given their current level of enjoyment. The tone is informal and personal, not aggressive or hostile.

1. The label 'normal' indicates that the text lacks explicit hate speech or severely offensive content.

4. Tone and Context: The overall tone appears to be jovial, with the ""lol"" indicating laughter, suggesting the comment is not intended to harm or offend.

The text ""smack lips aww sheeiit im a gorilla happy coon day"" is classified as hate speech, primarily due to its use of highly inflammatory and racially charged language.

Key Features:
- The use of terms like ""gorilla"" and ""coon"" are blatant slurs directed at African individuals. These words are not only dehumanizing but also invoke a long history of racial degradation.
  
Impact on Target Group:
- By employing such language, the text directly targets individuals of African descent, perpetuating negative stereotypes that equate them to primates. This comparison is deeply demeaning and offensive.

Context and Tone:
- The tone appears jovial or sarcastic with phrases like ""smack lips"", ""aww"" and ""happy coon day"". However, this does not mitigate the harm caused by the use of slurs but rather compounds their offensiveness by trivializing serious issues of bigotry.
  
Conclusion:
This text is classified as hate speech due to its explicit use of derogatory terms aimed at a specific ethnic group. The language used dehumanizes and demeans individuals of African descent, contributing significantly to a hostile environment. Despite any seemingly lighthearted tone, the usage of such slurs solidifies its classification as hate speech.",29.4,"[ 3.100863   -1.2265869  -0.83461607 ...  4.2929306  -4.9392366

1. The label 'normal' implies that the text does not contain any hate speech or overtly offensive content. This is evident, as the user shares their struggles with identity and expression in a reflective manner.
2. There are no key features identified that would suggest otherwise; the language used is neutral and non-inflammatory.
3. While it references a specific cultural group (Macedonian), this reference does not carry any negative connotations or stereotyping. It's merely a part of the user's personal context.
4. The tone is introspective, indicating an intent to share personal experiences rather than provoke or offend.

The text references broader societal issues – ""rape culture"" and ""gold-digging culture"" – without directly attacking any group. While these topics are sensitive and the argument could be seen as oversimplifying complex social dynamics, it doesn't cross into hate speech or direct offensiveness.

2. Key features supporting the normal classification include the lack of overtly inflammatory language or slurs targeting any specific group. 

3. The text refers to the challenges faced by Muslim and atheist ex-Muslim asylum seekers in gaining acceptance in Western countries. Though critical, it does not employ dehumanizing or blatantly prejudiced rhetoric against a particular group.

4. Analyzing the context and tone suggests the user is expressing frustration over perceived hypocrisies in refugee policies rather than promoting hostility towards any demographic.

Explanation: The text contains multiple instances of derogatory language towards Muslims and Islam, including the use of the term ""racist overlords.""

1. **Label Implication**: Labeling the text as ""offensive"" suggests that it contains language or ideas that could insult or harm the target groups.
2. **Key Features**: The request to ""name one positive thing that blacks or muslimes have brought to the west on their own"" highlights a dismissive tone towards contributions from African and Islamic cultures, implying they've made no significant independent contributions.
3. **Impact on Target Group**: By questioning the value of their unique cultural contributions to Western society, the text undermines the dignity and worth of these groups.
4. **Context and Tone**: The tweet's phrasing suggests a challenge or provocation rather than genuine inquiry, which is often indicative of an underlying negative bias against the targeted communities.

Key features such as ""little"", which implies insignificance or inferiority, compound the offense by further demeaning the target group members. Together with explicit slurs like ""kike"" and ""whore"", these terms construct a hostile environment that promotes hatred against both Jewish people and women.

The tweet's context reveals an intent to incite animosity towards the mentioned individuals by calling for their dismissal in a pejorative manner, reinforcing its classification as hate speech.

The usage of the term ""bitch"" directs an aggressive tone towards women, promoting a misogynistic view that undermines their value and character. This classification is justified by:

1. **Key Features**: The word ""bitch"" is pivotal in defining the tweet's offensiveness. It is often used pejoratively to demean or insult women.
2. **Target Group**: While there isn't a specific individual targeted, the generalization towards women as expecting too much and being overly demanding categorizes this under misogynistic language.
3. **Tone and Intent**: The tweet's tone is combative, showing resistance to perceived demands. This aggressive posture intensifies the offense caused by the terminology used.

However, these terms are not directed towards any specific group or individual. The tweet seems to express personal frustration about a media figure's return without repercussions but does so using general and non-specific insults.

Key Features:
- Usage of strong language: The words chosen by the user are usually associated with negative characteristics. However, they're used here more in a colloquial sense of disapproval than to target or demean any particular group.
- Absence of clear targeting: While the terms used could be considered as hate speech when directed at specific individuals or groups, there's no direct or indirect reference indicating such direction.

Conclusion:
The tweet expresses displeasure about someone being brought back without consequences but does not single out a group or individual for attack. It uses strong language for emphasis, yet remains general in its application. Therefore, despite the seemingly harsh language used, it doesn't qualify as hate speech or even an overtly offensive statement due to the lack of targeted insults. The classification of normal acknowledges the use of colloquial and emphatic language but recognizes that no specific harm is intended towards any group or individual.",29.12,"[-3.0023117   4.0365157  -4.9700418  ...  9.448554    0.73155314

The text targets the Islamic faith by using an ethnic and religious slur, which contributes to its classification as hate speech. The user's intent appears to be ridiculing and demeaning both the target individual (hypocrite) and the broader group (Muslims) due to perceived political alliances.

Explanation: The user's statement contains an extreme and unfounded claim that ""speaking in tongues"" cured world hunger, eradicated diseases, and saved millions of children from rape and murder. While the intent may not be to target or demean any particular group, the statement is offensive due to its outlandish and exaggerated nature, which could potentially be perceived as disruptive or disrespectful to readers.

The reference to a caliphate implies a conspiracy theory about Islam.

The text's target is clear: it disparages Muslim-majority countries, Islamic culture, and women who may live under such regimes. The language used aims to provoke negative emotions against these groups by portraying them in an extremely unfavorable light.

The user's intent appears to be to incite hatred or contempt for the specified groups by making baseless accusations and employing highly charged, xenophobic terminology.

1. The tweet contains blatantly anti-Semitic language, specifically the term ""kike lovers"" which is a slur against Jewish people and their supporters. This marks it as hate speech.

2. It uses the phrase ""jew satans messenger in the flesh"", further demonstrating hostility towards Jewish individuals by associating them with Satan and evil. 

3. The tweet urges its audience to ""mark"" these individuals, implying some form of identification or targeting for potential harm, which is a hallmark of hate speech.

4. The aggressive tone and clear intent to incite hatred against a specific religious group confirms the classification as hate speech.

In summary, the tweet's use of extreme anti-Semitic slurs, dehumanizing language, and calls for targeted actions against Jewish people and their supporters unequivocally categorizes it as hate speech intended to spread bigotry and harm.",21.14,"[-0.96415097  0.3108377   1.3418803  ... 13.117744   -3.6384711

The user mentions having flashbacks to a past event where they were ""jumped in the hallways"" and were not helped because of their sexual orientation, as indicated by the use of the derogatory term ""faggot.""

The reference to being jumped and the use of a slur might seem contentious; however, the tweet does not appear to be promoting hatred or targeting any group. Instead, it is reflecting on the user's own past experience in relation to the topic of toxic masculinity discussed in the documentary.

Though the language used is coarse and could be considered offensive when used out of context, within this tweet, it serves to highlight the personal impact of bullying and toxic behaviors. The term ""faggot"" is not used to target or demean anyone but rather to illustrate how such language was employed during a negative experience linked with toxic masculinity.

Given these points, despite the harsh terms, the tweet is classified as normal because its intent seems to be sharing a personal anecdote related to the broader topic of toxic masculinity and its effects. It does not aim to incite hatred or attack any specific group but rather reflects on the user's own experience in this context.

In summary:
- The tweet shares a personal experience connected with the documentary.
- Though harsh language is used, it serves to illustrate past mistreatment and is not directed at anyone within the tweet.
- The tweet does not promote or endorse the violence or bigotry described but uses it to relate to the subject of toxic masculinity.

The key feature in this text is the word ""bitches"" itself, an explicit and aggressive term that carries negative connotations.

The tweet directly targets women by expressing frustration and difficulty in dating them. The generalization and hostile language contribute to making the statement offensive. 

The context and tone of the message suggest a strong dislike or disrespect towards women, further supported by the use of informal and aggressive language like ""piss me off.""

In conclusion, the classification as **Offensive** is justified due to the targeted use of derogatory language aimed at women, creating an environment that perpetuates misogyny.

This classification is supported by the key feature, ""nigger,"" which is a well-known slur that promotes bigotry and prejudice against people of African descent. The usage of such language in any context is inherently inflammatory and serves no purpose other than to demean and insult based on race.

The target group, identified as African, is directly attacked with the use of this term, making it an explicit expression of hate speech. There is no context provided where such a term could be considered neutral or justified; its historical baggage and current societal perception make it unquestionably hate speech.

The tone of the text appears casual yet pejorative, indicating an intent to belittle or insult the target group without provocation or reason. The lack of any mitigating context suggests that this was an intentional choice by the user to engage in hostile language targeting a specific racial demographic.

In conclusion, based on the presence and use of an explicit racial slur with no justifying context or alternative interpretation, ""city erea and nigger ofcourse"" is classified as hate speech.

The key feature supporting this classification is the term ""kike"", which is a derogatory slur used against Jewish people. This word choice deliberately aims to demean and insult the targeted person based on their ethnicity, making it a clear example of hate speech.

Moreover, the tweet's tone and language are aggressively hostile, using additional terms like ""fat boomer goblin"" in conjunction with the ethnic slur. The cumulative impact of these words creates an atmosphere of intense bigotry and intolerance.

2. The phrase ""you niggers be out coonin"" employs another derogatory term ('cooning') directed at African Americans, indicating they're acting in a stereotypically foolish or uncouth manner.
3. The statement ""a cmon my nigga will slip out every now and again"" reveals the user's casual use of such slurs even in mixed company.

The text clearly targets the African American community with its language, which is both inflammatory and demeaning. Despite the speaker acknowledging their hesitance around white friends, they still show a lack of regard for the impact these words have.

- ""chimpathizer"": A term implying someone supports or sympathizes with chimpanzees over humans, potentially suggesting the target is less than human.
- ""mudshark"": A slur combining ""mud"" (a variation of a racial epithet) and ""shark,"" likely used to dehumanize the target.
- ""cunt"": An extremely vulgar term for female genitalia, used here in an aggressively misogynistic manner.  
- ""spaghetti"": Possibly referencing the target's Italian heritage in a derisory way.
- ""nigger"": A highly offensive and historically weighted racial slur against Black people.

The text employs these terms to denigrate and dehumanize multiple groups, including women, Italians, and particularly African-Americans. The tone is aggressive and intensely hostile, with language choices clearly intended to offend and degrade the targets.

1. **Summary**: Despite using informal language like ""my nigga"", the tweet lacks explicit hate or aggressive offense directed at any specific group. 

2. **Key Features Analysis**: No overtly controversial phrases were identified that would reclassify this as hate speech or even offensively biased.

3. **Target Impact**: The text doesn't appear to target a particular demographic negatively, rather it seems to be an informal, friendly statement between users.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**: Given the colloquial tone and lack of inflammatory language, it's reasonable to assume no malicious intent behind this interaction.

The key feature that supports this classification is the term 'nigger', which has historically been used to oppress and demean individuals of African descent. This term targets the African group, reinforcing historical patterns of prejudice and violence.

The context suggests an intent to provoke anger or distress in the target ('derek'), further solidifying its hate speech categorization. The use of such a potent slur, combined with the aggressive tone, aims to marginalize and harm based on ethnicity.

So in summary, while the tone is aggressive and the accusations serious, I don't see clear evidence of this being hate speech directed at a protected group based on identity.

However, it does not explicitly target any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics.

Key Features:
- The usage of crude language like ""pussy hoe"" and ""ghetto"". These terms are often considered vulgar and demeaning.
- The expression of personal dislike (""i hate hearing it"") without directing the sentiment towards a specific group or individual. 

Target: 
- No explicit target is identified in the text.

Label Implication:
- Despite the profanity, the tweet falls under the ""normal"" category due to lack of direct targeting of protected groups or promotion of violence/hatred.

Conclusion:
The tweet contains strong language and expresses dislike for a phrase but does not meet the criteria for hate speech or targeted offense.

- The tweet contains explicit hate speech directed at former President Obama, using the derogatory term ""muzrat"" which is a combination of ""Muslim"" and ""rat"". This term is deeply offensive to the Islamic community.
- It also labels him as a ""traitor"", furthering intensifying the hatred. 
- The key features ""muzrat"" and ""traitor"" are crucial in classifying this text as hate speech due to their blatantly pejorative nature, aiming to dehumanize and malign both Obama's character and faith.
- By asserting that everything Obama did was ""bad for America"", it promotes a conspiratorial narrative against him based on his race and religion. 
- The tweet's vitriolic tone reveals the user's intent to incite animosity towards Obama, exploiting his Muslim heritage to stoke bigotry.

- The context suggests a strong animosity towards individuals associated with these groups, indicating a clear intention to harm or promote hatred against them.

The text contains multiple elements that categorize it as hate speech. Key features such as the term ""thot"" (a derogatory slang for a sexually promiscuous woman), and particularly the use of the word ""nigger,"" play significant roles in this classification.

- The usage of the slur ""nigger"" is a blatant act of targeting African individuals with a deeply offensive and historically weighted term. This directly contributes to the hate speech label.
  
- Furthermore, the text mentions anxiety about society shared by a girl of the same age, which adds context to the speaker's mindset. However, this is overshadowed by the endorsement of using the slur in the fight for free speech.

Despite being used colloquially in some contexts, its usage here lacks any context that might mitigate its offensiveness. 

However, without additional information about who or what ""ynw melly"" refers to, we cannot definitively classify this tweet as hate speech targeting a specific individual or group based solely on the content provided.

Given these factors, I would classify it as **offensive** rather than neutral or hate speech:

The tweet's use of a severe racial epithet without clear context crosses the line into offensiveness. The key feature - the slur ""nigga"" - is an inflammatory term that demeans and attacks based on race.

While this lone word doesn't necessarily indicate the broader intent needed for a hate speech classification, its presence alone warrants an offensive rating due to the profound offense such language causes.

In summary, despite ambiguity about the full target, the unambiguous inclusion of an egregious slur directs serious offense toward a racial group. This elevates it above a neutral categorization and into the realm of clearly objectionable content.",24.51,"[-2.8124304   0.14582087  5.909352   ...  4.147102   -6.5438004

This classification as 'normal' may be mistaken due to the aggressive tone and targeted profanity.

Key features that challenge the 'normal' label:
- The use of the expletive ""fuck"" twice.
- Direct antagonism towards law enforcement.
- The extension of hostility to anyone who supports police.

The aggressive language and targeting of a specific group (police officers and their supporters) suggests this text falls into the 'offensive' category rather than being normal. It lacks the elements typically associated with hate speech, such as slurs or incitement to violence, but the combative tone and direct use of profanity make it more fitting for an 'offensive' classification.

In conclusion, while not quite escalating to hate speech, the text's explicit language and targeting make it better suited for an 'offensive' label rather than being considered normal discourse.",21.39,[ 2.2778997 -3.1238348 -1.0311378 ... 11.679951  -6.972083   4.5840487],1," offensive.

Explanation: The text expresses a hostile sentiment towards the police, but it does not meet the criteria for hate speech as it does not specifically target any particular group based on their race, religion, gender, or other protected characteristic. However, the language used is offensive and could be perceived as threatening or intimidating. It's important to note that expressing negative opinions or sentiments towards certain groups or institutions does not necessarily equate to hate speech, but using offensive language or threats can cross the line into harassment or intimidation. In this case, the text falls into the category of offensive due to its use of profanity and hostile tone."

Firstly, there's no direct usage of overtly hate speech or highly inflammatory language targeting a specific group. The reference to ""sherry fatso kim"" could be seen as mildly insulting but lacks the intensity and specificity typical of hate speech.

Key features that support this classification include:
- No explicit or slurs used.
- Generalized criticism without detailed attacks on personal characteristics.

The target appears to be economic, yet the text doesn't contain clear economic commentary. The reference to ""mil indus complex"" hints at systemic critique but remains vague and lacks direct offense.

In terms of tone and context, the user expresses frustration using strong language like ""bullshit."" However, this falls short of crossing into hate speech or even highly offensive territory. It's more an expression of personal opinion or dissatisfaction rather than targeted vitriol.

Conclusion:
Based on these factors - lack of explicit slurs, generalized rather than specific attacks, and the overall tone being one of general frustration rather than direct hatred - I classify this as normal speech, despite some potentially inflammatory elements falling short of hate speech or severe offensiveness.",27.54,[ 2.63206    1.172869   3.3221161 ...  8.081162   2.0391076 -2.2987587],1, normal

The tweet employs the term ""muzrat,"" a pejorative blend of ""Muslim"" and ""rat,"" which is both derogatory and dehumanizing, aiming to incite hatred towards Muslims. Coupled with the phrase ""terrorist attack,"" it creates a narrative that vilifies an entire religious group based on the actions of extremists.

The classification as hate speech is further supported by:

1. **Dehumanizing Language**: The use of ""muzrat"" reduces members of the Islamic faith to vermin-like creatures, promoting a dehumanized view and fostering animosity.
   
2. **Generalization**: By linking ""terrorist attack"" specifically with Muslims, it unfairly attributes acts of terror to an entire religion, disregarding the vast majority who condemn such violence.

3. **Stereotyping**: It reinforces negative stereotypes about Islam, suggesting that all followers are potential terrorists.

In conclusion, this tweet is classified as hate speech because it utilizes inflammatory language and generalizations that encourage prejudice against Muslims by connecting them with terrorism and degrading their faith community.",25.51,"[ 0.13972768  2.3042448  -7.54193    ...  8.386396   -0.11709917

1. The usage of highly inflammatory and derogatory terms such as ""jew"" and ""nigger"". These words are clear indicators of the text's intent to demean and marginalize both Jewish and African groups.

2. The call for a ""nationalist socialist eu"", which seeks to ensure that every nation is free of Jews and African people, explicitly promotes ethnic cleansing and segregation. This genocidal rhetoric is a hallmark of extreme hate speech.

3. The targeting of British state media for producing content in Arabic further emphasizes an anti-Muslim sentiment, suggesting that the presence of other languages and cultures is unwelcome.

4. The phrase ""take cares of their traditions and its values"" implies a desire to preserve a monocultural society devoid of diversity, reinforcing the hate speech classification by promoting cultural supremacy.

In conclusion, the text's use of overtly racist language and its advocacy for an exclusionary, ethnocentric ideology justify its categorization as hate speech.

The key phrase here is ""shut up faggot,"" which contains explicitly hostile language directed at homosexual individuals. The inclusion of this term reveals a clear intent to demean and offend based on sexual orientation, hence classifying it as offensive. 

The target of the tweet is the homosexual community, with the slur serving as the primary mechanism of offense. The context provided by the key features indicates a tone of aggression and hostility towards the user being addressed.

In conclusion, this classification is justified by the direct usage of an inflammatory homophobic term aimed at silencing and insulting the targeted individual based on their sexual orientation.",15.76,"[ 5.8768477  -0.6774289   0.70479965 ... 10.875025   -5.910131

Explanation: The use of the derogatory slur ""faggot"" towards someone is a clear example of hate speech targeting the LGBTQ+ community. This language is intended to demean, bully, and incite harm against individuals based on their sexual orientation. It's important to remember that using such language creates a hostile environment for people and can perpetuate discrimination and intolerance. Therefore, this text should be classified as hate speech. However, since the instructions ask for only one-word replies, ""offensive"" will suffice."

Key features supporting this classification include:

1. Usage of ""muzzie,"" which is a derogatory slang for Muslims.
2. Reference to an ""invasion,"" which connotes a hostile takeover, amplifying the negative sentiment.

The text targets Muslim refugees, implying they pose a safety threat that deterred the speaker from travelling. The tone reflects fearmongering and xenophobia, contributing to the hate speech classification. This framing encourages prejudice against an already marginalized group, reinforcing harmful stereotypes.

In conclusion, the use of inflammatory language directed at a religious minority and the overall sentiment of fear and hostility solidify this text's categorization as hate speech.",16.37,[ 2.3207211  3.6729443 -6.925134  ...  9.447318  -2.6688933  0.6864723],0, hate speech

The language used is extremely hostile, revealing a prejudiced stance against the mentioned communities. By employing such provocative slurs, the user aims to degrade and incite animosity towards these groups.

The phrase targets refugees and people of certain national origins, promoting xenophobic sentiments. Additionally, it expresses hope that the whistleblower is either female, an immigrant from such a country, or someone who identifies as gender nonconforming or trans – suggesting these identities would somehow diminish credibility or be grounds for criticism.

Key features supporting this classification include the word ""shithole"", which is an aggressively disparaging term often used to degrade countries and by extension their inhabitants. The phrase ""or maybe an immigrant from a shithole country"" reinforces the notion of immigrants as 'other' and unwelcome, particularly if they are from specific nations. 

The tweet's tone is markedly sarcastic with an undertone of hostility towards certain social groups. It aims to undermine the whistleblower's credibility based on gender identity or national origin, which is a common tactic in xenophobic and transphobic rhetoric.

In conclusion, the tweet is deemed ""offensive"" due to its use of inflammatory language and clear targeting of multiple social groups - immigrants from specific countries, women, and individuals with non-binary gender identities.

Key points:
- The text lacks any clear derogatory language or negative connotations.
- The tone appears playful and non-threatening, with the usage of emojis suggesting a positive context.
- There is no direct targeting or malice against individuals or groups based on sexual orientation.

The casual mention of ""this extra gay person"" could be seen as mildly humorous self-deprecation rather than an attack on anyone's identity. Given this understanding, the tweet does not qualify as hate speech or even overtly offensive content.

- The use of emojis adds a lighthearted and non-serious tone to the text.
- Phrases like ""big [attribute] energy"" are used humorously, not aggressively or offensively.
- There is no clear target or intent to harm or offend in the language used.

The overall context suggests the user is jokingly comparing different types of energetic personas, using exaggerated terms for humorous effect. While some phrases might be considered crude out of context, here they appear intended to amuse rather than offend.

3. The target group is identified as 'Homosexual', indicating the text's focus on issues affecting this community.

The phrase ""kill yourself you will meet yourself there"" could potentially suggest self-harm, which is a sensitive and serious topic.

However, given the fragmented nature of the text and the absence of any context or identifiable target group, classifying this as either hate speech or purely offensive would be inaccurate without more information. 

Key points supporting its classification as ""normal"":
- The tweet does not contain language that directly targets individuals or groups in a derogatory or threatening manner.
- There is no evident intent to incite harm, promote violence, or perpetuate stereotypes.

While the mention of self-harm is concerning and could potentially be part of an offensive context, in isolation and without additional information, it's most appropriate to classify this text as normal. The incomplete nature of the message prevents a more definitive categorization.

In summary, based on the limited available data and the absence of clearly identifiable hate speech or direct offense, this tweet is classified as ""normal"". However, it should be noted that discussions around self-harm, even when unclear like in this case, warrant caution and sensitivity.",27.62,[ 4.005532  -3.5494242  0.6664518 ... 10.092241  -2.883334   1.6685303],1," offensive.

- The tweet contains a single phrase which appears to be a misspelling or slang term. This term has been identified as 'dindunuffin', which seems to reference the n-word.

- The key feature driving this classification is the use of the word 'dindunuffin' which is a variant of a highly offensive and racially charged slur directed towards individuals of African descent.

- While no specific group or individual is explicitly targeted, the nature of the term itself carries an inherent bigotry that promotes hostility against people of African origin. 

- The context in which this term was used lacks any redeeming qualities such as humor or irony which could have potentially mitigated its offensiveness. Rather, it appears to be employed gratuitously with the apparent intention to degrade and demean based on race.

- In conclusion, despite the lack of additional context, the use of 'dindunuffin' - a variant of an extremely denigrating racial slur against African people - within this tweet justifies its classification as hate speech.

However, the key features list is empty which makes it difficult to perform an in-depth analysis.

The reference to Hitler and a claim that he did nothing could potentially be seen as minimizing the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, but without more context it's hard to definitively classify this.

Given the limited information provided, on the surface this text seems to fall into the ""normal"" category based on lack of overt hate speech or targeted offense. However, the vague reference to Hitler warrants caution and further examination would be prudent to fully assess any potentially toxic meaning.

The intent appears to be provocatively antagonistic, using shocking language for attention or confrontation. The tweet's framing of an intimate act with a racist slur aims to demean and degrade both African individuals and women, reinforcing negative stereotypes.

The tweet expresses an opinion about Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo (CR7) using hyperbolic language (""god"") commonly found in sports discourse.

Key Features:
- ""las palmas"" is a Spanish football team, and comparing Real Madrid to Las Palmas suggests the author views them as underdogs.
- Calling CR7 a ""god"" implies extraordinary skill or ability, typical of fan rhetoric.

Target: 
- The target appears to be fans or followers of sports, particularly football (soccer).

Tone & Intent:
- The tone is mildly sarcastic or hyperbolic but lacks any real malice. The intent seems to provoke discussion or share an opinion on the teams and player mentioned.

The text is classified as neutral because it engages in typical sports fan rhetoric without targeting any group negatively, using language that's common in this context.

1. Usage of extreme slurs: Terms like ""whore,"" ""nigger,"" and ""shitskins"" are extremely pejorative, targeting women, African-Americans, and Caucasians respectively.
2. Promotes violence: The statement ""she must die for this"" incites violence against the targeted individual, further reinforcing its classification as hate speech.
3. Contributes to ethnic, religious, and gender stereotypes: It associates Jewish individuals with manipulation (""worked with jewish producers"") and suggests that interracial relationships are negative (""racemixing"").
4. Objectifies women: Referring to Taylor Swift as ""a whore"" who ""went through a lot of men"" reduces her to sexual object status.

The overall impact is severely detrimental, using dehumanizing language, advocating violence, and perpetuating damaging stereotypes against multiple groups. The context and tone convey clear animosity, with no redeeming or mitigating factors that could classify it otherwise.

1. The tweet discusses representation in government, focusing on various identities such as cisgender, heterosexual white Christian men. It highlights a societal issue without employing hate speech or direct offense towards any group.

2. Key Features: Although no specific keywords are identified, the text emphasizes underrepresentation and identity politics, crucial for understanding its context. It argues that class, particularly poverty, is often overlooked in these discussions.

3. Target: While the tweet mentions specific identities, it does so to highlight disparities in representation rather than to target or demean any group. The main focus is on raising awareness about a perceived lack of representation based on economic status.

4. Tone and Intent: The tone is argumentative but not aggressive or abusive. It questions the sincerity of identity politics that ignore class differences, suggesting a more nuanced approach to addressing societal inequalities.

    - The text doesn't explicitly target a particular demographic. While it implies a general comparison between different types of males, it lacks the specificity needed for a targeted offense.

1. Label Implication:
   - The classification indicates the presence of content that may cause offense or discomfort, often through the use of strong language or the promotion of negative stereotypes.
   
2. Key Features Justification:
   - The term ""redneck"" is a key feature contributing to the classification. It's used here in a pejorative manner, stereotyping a group based on cultural and geographical attributes.

3. Target Group Impact:
   - The text targets individuals from southern U.S. regions, painting them in a negative light through the use of the term ""redneck"". This perpetuates a stereotype that can be considered demeaning and insulting.
   
4. Context and Tone Assessment:
   - While the tweet appears to describe a dream, which might suggest it's not intended to be taken literally, the strong language used (""fucked up"", ""massacre"") and the repetitive use of ""redneck"" indicate an intent to offend or shock.

5. Conclusion Justification:
    - The combination of explicit language, negative stereotyping of a group based on geographic origin, and the context in which these elements are used justify the classification of this text as offensive. It's crucial to note that while dreams can contain disturbing imagery, the choice of words and the target of the negativity is what pushes this into the realm of an intentionally provocative or insulting statement.",32.67,[ 2.0078275 -1.4106143 -1.9600785 ...  9.33053   -4.1069927  7.126697 ],2," Offensive.

Explanation: The text uses explicit language and negative stereotyping towards people from southern U.S. regions, perpetuating a harmful stereotype. While it is described as a dream, the use of strong language and derogatory terms justifies its classification as offensive."

- The tweet contains the term ""muzrat,"" which is a blend of the words ""Muslim"" and ""rat."" This term is a clear slur directed at individuals who follow the Islamic faith. Its usage in association with the phrase ""terrorist attack"" intensifies the hate speech, as it conflates an entire religious group with terrorism.
- The key feature ""muzrat"" is particularly inflammatory and supports the classification of this text as hate speech. It dehumanizes and vilifies based on religion.
- This text specifically targets Arab and Islamic communities by using a bigoted term that equates them with vermin, in the context of discussing a terrorist attack. This promotes an environment of fear and hostility towards these groups.
- The tone of this tweet is hostile and inflammatory, further reinforcing its classification as hate speech.

In conclusion, based on the usage of the highly derogatory term ""muzrat"" and its direct targeting of Arab and Islamic communities in association with terrorism, this text is classified as hate speech.

The tone is aggressive and provocative, revealing an intent to harm and offend the target group. By employing slurs and references to violent acts, the user's language goes beyond mere offensiveness into explicit hate speech.

Given its scattered nature and lack of a unifying sentiment of hate or offense, this tweet is best classified as normal. It seems more an expression of political dissatisfaction rather than an attempt to incite hatred or cause offense.

In summary, the text's classification as 'normal' stems from its disjointed presentation of various controversial topics without clear promotion of harm or bigotry towards any group.",19.76,"[-2.6243062  -1.9647827   0.5621562  ...  5.9303646  -0.51094353

Key features supporting this classification include the use of ""moslem,"" a misspelling intended to mock and deride Muslims, and ""libtards,"" a blend of ""liberal"" and ""retard,"" conveying a strong negative sentiment towards liberal individuals.

The text targets multiple groups including Arabs, heterosexuals, Islamic followers, minorities, refugees, and women. The author's intent seems to be to offend these groups by associating them with the pejorative terms used.

While not explicitly advocating violence or expressing hate, the language used is clearly intended to insult and demean, crossing the line from merely controversial to outright offensive.

This word choice reveals a strong prejudice towards homosexuals, contributing significantly to the classification.

In this context, the target group is clearly the homosexual community. The tweet's intent appears to be mocking or denigrating the individual mentioned, specifically because of his perceived sexuality. 

The tone of the text is derisive and hostile, further supporting its categorization as hate speech. By employing such a loaded term in relation to an individual's profession (""fashion designer""), it perpetuates negative stereotypes about gay men.

In conclusion, the tweet's use of a well-known homophobic slur in a context that mocks and demeans a person based on their sexuality justifies its classification as hate speech.

Explanation:
- The user input makes a derogatory remark about someone being a ""word class faggot."" This term is used as an insult and targets individuals who are perceived to be homosexual, which constitutes hate speech against the LGBTQ+ community.

The reference to the film ""Deliverance"" and its associated themes of violence could suggest an aggressive intent. However, without clear indications of hate speech or direct offense beyond general mockery, this falls short of those classifications.

Key points include:
- Mockery of appearance and ancestry.
- Reference to a violent movie scene involving rape.
  
The target is specified as Caucasian with no specific group mentioned, so while the tone is derisive, it lacks clear indicators of hate speech. The insult, though crude, doesn't utilize explicit slurs or direct threats that would categorize this as hate speech.

In conclusion, the text contains an insulting remark but does not rise to the level of hate speech or significant offensiveness due to its lack of specific targeted language and its focus on personal mockery rather than group-based animus.

Key points:
- The phrase ""so called negroes"" could be seen as problematic; however, in this context, it seems to reflect the user's view of their own identity rather than being a direct attack.
- The mention of ""hebrew brethren"" suggests an intra-group discussion rather than an external critique or insult.

The tweet does not directly insult any group and mainly focuses on the user's personal religious conviction.

1. The label 'normal' implies that the text is neutral and does not contain elements of hate speech or offensiveness. This perspective suggests that the content is benign and suitable for general audiences.

2. Key features: While no specific key features have been provided in the data, a critical examination reveals the phrase ""moslem men playing skittles"" as potentially problematic. The term ""moslem"" appears to be a misspelling or a deliberate misrepresentation of the word ""Muslim,"" which could be interpreted as mocking or pejorative.

3. Target: Although no specific target group has been identified, the text seems to reference Muslim men indirectly through the aforementioned phrase. This could potentially stir negative connotations or perpetuate stereotypes about this demographic.

4. Context and tone: The statement ""nobody should be upset"" suggests a dismissive attitude towards any potential offense caused by the text's content. The casual mention of ""playing skittles,"" which seems to be a reference to the game 'skittles,' could imply a trivialization or misrepresentation of activities associated with Muslim men.

5. Conclusion: While initially classified as normal, this text contains elements that might be viewed as subtly derisive towards a specific religious group due to the choice of words and context. However, it stops short of direct vilification or aggressive language typically seen in hate speech or overtly offensive content.

The tweet's reference to homosexuality is negative and hostile, showcasing an intent to demean and insult. This kind of targeted language can be extremely damaging, perpetuating a culture of homophobia and intolerance.

- The mention of ""nazi"" and ""white race"" could be misinterpreted but seem to be part of a disagreement over terminology and historical accuracy.
- No direct slurs or dehumanizing language is used against any group.
- The user reports being blocked, suggesting a heated debate rather than targeted abuse.

The text's reference to Nazis and the white race touches on sensitive issues. However, it appears to critique someone else's misuse of terms and historical inaccuracies rather than promoting bigotry itself.

- The phrase ""white nationalist"" is a clear indicator of the text's stance.
- Acknowledgment of embracing ancestry, genes, and origins with a ""white and proud"" sentiment.

4. The context appears to be about media reporting and celebrity behavior. There's no clear indication that the user intends harm or offense.

The term ""mudslime"" is a clear slur against Muslims, contributing significantly to the hate speech label by dehumanizing and insulting followers of Islam. The mention of genital mutilation in connection with Islamic law insinuates barbaric practices, further vilifying the religion and its adherents. 

Additionally, questioning why no burqa was worn incites division and intolerance towards religious dress codes. The overall tone is hostile and demeaning, aiming to provoke anger and resentment against Islam.

The text appears to criticize the concept of global patience in light of alleged atrocities committed against Kashmiri Hindus by Islamic militants. It accuses these groups of murder, rape, and forced displacement, expressing anger over perceived lack of international concern for these issues.

Despite the serious nature of the grievances expressed, the use of charged language and generalizations about entire ethnic or religious communities renders the tweet offensive. The terms ""pak"" and ""paki"" are particularly provocative and bigoted.

- ""Raped wallets"" is a figurative expression of financial burden, not literal harm. 
- No slurs or dehumanizing language are present.

- Description of gang violence specifically targeting people based on race, which incites inter-racial tension and animosity.
- The phrase ""got super blackpilled"" suggests endorsement or glorification of such violent acts.

   - The phrase ""supreme boi"" is slang and does not appear to target any specific group negatively.

""Mudshark"" similarly demeans by comparing the targeted individual to a lowly aquatic creature. The use of the n-word compounds this hatred.

- The tweet text contains the word ""retarded"", which is a term often used offensively to refer to someone with intellectual disabilities.

Key Features:
- Mention of a teacher's role in examining ""the full history usage"" which supports an educational intent.
- The contrast drawn between analyzing words in context vs. their use by racists highlights the distinction between neutral academic discussion and hate speech.

While slurs are directed at various ethnic groups, their inclusion here is not meant to demean but to educate about ""why it so offensive"". This lessens potential harm through contextualization.

Context and Tone:
The tweet's tone is informative and seeks understanding. The focus on historical and literary analysis frames the language as educational material rather than bigotry.

Explanation: In this context, the use of racially derogatory terms by a history teacher while discussing racial disparities in literature and history is considered normal due to educational purposes. The intent behind using such language is not to harm or demean individuals but rather to provide historical accuracy and understanding. The teacher's role as an educator allows for the use of these terms, as long as they are used in a scholarly context to shed light on past discriminatory practices and their impact on various communities.

However, it is important to note that using such language outside of an academic or educational setting can still be offensive and harmful. In everyday conversations, it's crucial to respect others' feelings and avoid using derogatory terms that can cause pain or perpetuate negative stereotypes."

2. The phrase ""chinese dyke"" lumps two identities together in a potentially reductive way, especially when coupled with the speaker's professed ignorance about their existence.

3. Referring to someone as ""a chinese dyke"" rather than just noting they are Chinese and a lesbian woman could be seen as objectifying or exoticizing them.

Key features include the use of terms like ""isis,"" ""sharia law,"" and ""jihad"" in close association with the term ""islam.""

The tweet's content seems to target all followers of Islam, suggesting that most Muslims support violent extremism and oppressive practices. By claiming ""all the same family most moslem believe isis sharia law are in compliance with islam,"" it paints a monolithic picture of a diverse faith group, promoting an 'us vs them' mentality.

The choice of words such as ""caliphate,"" often associated with ISIS's territorial claims, and ""al qaeda,"" known for its terror activities, contributes to the text's inflammatory tone. The phrase ""do not believe what they tell you"" suggests that Muslims are inherently deceptive.

Key features that support this classification:
- The term ""dyke"" is an aggressive and derogatory slang word used against women who identify as bisexual or homosexual.

Impact on target group:
- The language used targets the lesbian community by employing negative stereotypes, which can foster a hostile environment. 

Context and tone assessment:
- The overall message seems to downplay an individual's criticism towards another person, but does so through the use of prejudiced terminology. This reveals a disdainful attitude that perpetuates prejudice.

The text employs the highly inflammatory and abusive term ""nigger,"" which is an egregious slur targeting individuals of African descent. This word choice underpins the classification as hate speech, given its extreme offensiveness and historical context of oppression.

Key features such as ""nigger"" and ""lover"" are combined to express disdain towards anyone who supports or empathizes with the African community. The phrase ""sieg heil"" is a further indicator of the text's alignment with ideologies associated with white supremacy and intolerance, adding another layer of hate speech.

The target group is clearly identified as African individuals or those sympathetic to their cause, with the user expressing intent to exclude them from positions of power or respect (""into office"").

Considering the context and tone, it is evident that the user harbors significant animosity towards the targeted demographic. The uncompromising stance against ""nigger lovers"" and the aggressive language used (e.g., ""as fuck"") demonstrate a clear intention to offend and perpetuate hate.

- By suggesting that one group can dictate what language is acceptable for another to use about themselves, it promotes an inherently unequal power dynamic.

1. The use of extreme slurs degrading specific ethnic groups.
2. Advocating for the ""right"" of one group to use dehumanizing language against others.

The use of strong profanity like ""fucking"" and ""hate"" suggests a high level of aggression and negativity in sentiment. The term ""bitch"", when used towards women, is generally considered a misogynistic slur.

Despite these elements, without further context it's difficult to definitively classify this as hate speech, which typically involves broader attacks on a group based on race, ethnicity, religion etc. Here the target seems more individual/personal.

The aggressive tone and language could also be seen as crossing into offensive territory.

Its usage here is targeted towards individuals of African descent, making the tweet overtly hostile and bigoted.

The key feature supporting this classification is the employment of the word ""nigger"", which epitomizes the severity of the offense. It's not just a mere insult but a term that embodies generations of oppression, violence, and injustice.

The word ""niggas"" is an extreme racial slur with a long history of being used to demean and dehumanize black individuals. 

Despite the neutral label suggested in the input data, the presence of such inflammatory language overwhelmingly categorizes this text as hate speech. The tweet appears to generalize about black men's dating preferences in a disparaging manner, reinforcing negative stereotypes.

The context seems to contrast an idealized standard of love with the supposed unsuitability of the targeted group, further entrenching the prejudice and hostility conveyed by the slur. 

Given the extreme offensiveness of the language used and its direct targeting of a racial minority, this text is unequivocally classified as hate speech that promotes bigotry and animosity based on race. The key feature is the unabashed use of an infamous racial epithet, which alone suffices to classify this as abhorrent hate speech with no redeeming context or intent.

In summary:
- The tweet uses a severe racist slur to denigrate black men.
- It perpetuates negative stereotypes and contrasts them unfavorably.  
- The presence of such a vile epithet targeted at a protected group makes this unambiguously hate speech.
- No alternative interpretation can outweigh the core implication of virulent racism.

1. **Neutral Analysis**:
   - tweet_text: ""dyke call me c murda girl if you do not get the fuck""
   
While this text uses a derogatory term (""dyke"") and aggressive language, it does not specifically incite violence or direct hate towards any group. The phraseology appears to be more of an individual expression of frustration rather than systematic hate speech.

The key features are:
   - Usage of ""dyke"", which is a homophobic slur.
   - Aggressive tone with the phrase ""get the fuck"".
   
However, these elements alone don't conclusively categorize it as hate speech or even offensive. The context and intent seem more aligned with an individual venting frustration rather than promoting bigotry.

The target groups (""Homosexual, None"") suggest both a specific demographic being referenced and an undefined broad audience. This combination reduces the likelihood of targeted hate.

Considering tone and context, while provocative, this doesn't provide clear evidence of systematic hate or direct offense towards a group. It leans more into strong personal expression, which, albeit crude, falls short of constituting hate speech or overt offensiveness in a vacuum of further context.

In conclusion, the text contains inflammatory language but lacks explicit hate ideology or direct incitement. Its classification as 'normal' hinges on it being an isolated outburst devoid of clear promotion of bigotry or harm towards others.

By directing this term at the target and suggesting they should go elsewhere, the tweet demonstrates a clear intent to marginalize and ostracize Jewish individuals based on their identity.

The inclusion of the phrase ""non aryan"" further amplifies the hate speech by drawing a contrast between an idealized ""aryan"" race and all other groups perceived as inferior or undesirable. This kind of racial hierarchization has been historically associated with extreme forms of bigotry and oppression.

This word is often used in a derogatory manner to refer to women seen as promiscuous or sexually available. The key feature here is the usage of ""hoes,"" which perpetuates negative stereotypes about women and their roles or behaviors.

The target group for this tweet appears to be women, specifically those who may be perceived by the speaker to engage in certain sexual activities or have numerous relationships. This language objectifies and demeans women, reinforcing a patriarchal view that judges and categorizes women based on their sexual behavior.

While it could be argued that the tweet is attempting humor or casual conversation about relationships, the choice of words clearly targets and offends a specific group. The tone implies a competitive or judgemental stance towards women's personal choices, which can contribute to a culture where such language is normalized.

In conclusion, this tweet falls into the ""offensive"" category due to its use of a derogatory term that targets women and perpetuates negative gender stereotypes.

- The tweet_text employs highly inflammatory language, referring to a person as ""a moslem cockroach"". This term dehumanizes and vilifies the individual based on their religious affiliation. 
- Key features like ""moslem"" and ""cockroach"" in combination convey a strong negative sentiment towards Muslims, equating them with pests.
- The tweet targets Arab, Islam, and Other groups by using a religious identifier in a pejorative context along with an insect metaphor commonly associated with vermin or infestation. This serves to incite hate against these communities.
- While the text mentions anti-semitism, it twists this to attack another group, furthering inter-group animosity rather than promoting tolerance. The user's intent appears to be spreading hostility by leveraging existing tensions.

The tweet directly targets the Jewish community through the use of ""kike"" and by referencing the dreidle, a symbol associated with the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. This combination serves to perpetuate negative stereotypes and contributes to an atmosphere of intolerance.

In terms of context and tone, the user's intent appears to be inflammatory and disparaging towards Jewish people. The casual incorporation of such a pejorative term reveals a lack of respect and an attempt to belittle or insult the targeted group.

2. Although the user claims not to be ""tryna [trying] be ignorant,"" the question posed about life expectancy based on sexual orientation reveals an underlying prejudice or stereotype.

- The tweet is an observation rather than a targeted attack on any group.

The text's impact could be seen as mildly negative due to the reference to white supremacists, but it doesn't appear to intend harm or promote bigotry.

The tweet text contains a direct and hostile message aimed at an individual, utilizing the highly offensive term ""nigger"" which is a blatant racial slur. The phrase ""keep that same energy behind bars"" suggests a threat of violence or harm towards the targeted user, further amplifying the hate speech aspect.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- The use of the word ""stupid"", serving to degrade and insult the target's intelligence.
- The term ""nigger"", an unambiguous and deeply derogatory slur against African individuals, reinforcing a historical context of oppression and bigotry.

The combination of these key features creates a hostile environment that not only demeans the targeted individual but also promotes animosity towards the broader African community.

However, in this context, the author seems to be criticizing the overuse or misuse of this term by Canadians, attributing it to their exposure through rap music. The statement ""throwing it away"" suggests that they are disapproving the casual usage without understanding its historical and cultural significance.

While the language used is strong and potentially inflammatory, the intent appears not to promote hate but to critique a specific behavior. This makes the classification challenging as the line between critiquing a behavior and promoting hate can be thin.

- Usage of the term ""nigger""
- Reference to Canadians' behavior
- Critique of cultural appropriation in music

Target group:
- Canadians, African Americans

Tone and Intent:
The tone is disapproving and critical. The intent seems educational or corrective rather than promoting hate.

Conclusion:
Given that the text criticizes a specific behavior (overuse of a sensitive term) without directly attacking a group based on their inherent attributes, it leans towards being classified as ""offensive"" rather than ""hate speech"". However, its nuanced critique blurs the line.

This term is deeply offensive, targeting individuals of Jewish descent. The tweet's context suggests that doxxing - the malicious act of releasing private information online - is acceptable for this individual based on their perceived support for someone labeled with the slur. 

The key feature here is the word 'kike', which carries a heavy historical baggage of prejudice and hostility towards Jewish people. It's not just an insult, but a term meant to dehumanize and foster hate.

Moreover, the tweet implies endorsing doxxing against those associated with or supportive of the targeted group, amplifying its potential harm. The tone is inciting and provocative, intending to inflame pre-existing biases.

In conclusion, this tweet falls into the hate speech category due to its explicit use of a severe anti-Semitic slur in a context that suggests violence and harassment towards Jewish individuals or their supporters.

The text appears to be a response to an accusation of being a Nazi by using even more extreme hate speech against Jews and homosexuals. This not only insults the targeted groups but also attempts to diminish the severity and offensiveness of actual Nazi ideology and affiliation, which is an insult in itself according to the author.

The tone is hostile and aggressive, revealing a clear intent to cause offense and marginalize the mentioned communities through dehumanizing language. This text promotes intolerance and violence towards these demographics.

In conclusion, given the presence of multiple extreme slurs aimed at ethnic, religious, and sexual minorities combined with an attacking tone, this text unequivocally meets the criteria for classification as hate speech.

Explanation: The text contains multiple offensive slurs targeting different groups, including ""whiny wheezy nasally libtard,"" ""nazi,"" ""kike,"" and ""faggot."" These terms are intended to demean and belittle individuals based on their race, religion, political beliefs, and sexual orientation.

The use of the term ""libtard"" is a derogatory term often used to insult those with left-leaning political views, but it does not qualify as hate speech in itself. However, the text also contains the highly offensive slur ""kike,"" which directly targets Jewish individuals and has a long history of being used to demean and discriminate against them. The text also implies that the person being referred to is a Nazi, another term with deep historical significance and meaning.

Furthermore, the use of the term ""faggot"" to insult someone's sexual orientation is offensive and contributes to creating a hostile environment for LGBTQ+ individuals.

Therefore, the text as a whole contains multiple offensive statements and should be classified as offensive due to its derogatory language towards various groups."

It highlights how both Kashmiri women and men navigate these challenges while fostering a politics of resistance amidst escalating military violence from India.

The classification of this text as 'normal' is justified for several reasons:

1. The tweet presents an academic or scholarly perspective on a complex geopolitical issue, focusing on the experiences of a specific demographic group within that context.
2. It does not contain any language that can be construed as overtly hostile, aggressive, or demeaning towards any particular group or individual.
3. The tone is informative and analytical, aiming to shed light on an underexplored aspect of the conflict—namely, the gendered dimensions of trauma and resistance.

- The tweet contains multiple key features that indicate hate speech:
  - The use of the term ""yank"" is a derogatory slang aimed at Americans, specifically those from the Northern United States.
  - The phrase ""moslem,"" an intentionally mispronounced version of ""Muslim,"" further highlights the user's disdain for this religious group.
  - The phrases ""shove it fool"" and ""do not talk cack keak"" are aggressive and dismissive, displaying a hostile attitude towards the target.

- These key features work together to create a clear sentiment of hate:
  - The tweet targets Caucasians by using the slur ""yank,"" shows hostility towards Islam with the mispronounced ""moslem,"" and employs aggressive language.
  - This combination creates an environment of bigotry and animosity, which is reinforced through the tweet's tone.

- The intended target appears to be a Caucasian individual who practices Islam:
  - The user denies being a ""yank"" while also expressing disdain for someone else they consider a ""moslem.""
  - By coupling these terms with aggressive language, the tweet fosters an us-versus-them mentality that marginalizes both Caucasians and Muslims.

- The context of this tweet suggests a defensive posture by the user:
  - The use of ""firstly"" and ""secondly"" indicates a response to prior accusations or statements.
  - However, the subsequent aggressive language transforms the reply into an attack rather than a defense.

**Conclusion**

This tweet is classified as hate speech due to its use of derogatory slurs against both a religious group (""moslem"") and a perceived ethnic identity (""yank""). The inclusion of hostile language further cements this classification by creating a tone of aggression and intolerance. While the user's intent might have been defensive, the choice of words and overall sentiment veer into hate speech territory.",39.58,"[-0.59641373  2.2424767  -2.0819306  ...  5.084714   -3.0055614

**Explanation**:
1. The tweet discusses a specific incident involving Bill Maher's use of a racial slur and questions the lack of reaction from the left towards Cam Newton compared to this event.
   
2. While it references sensitive language, it does so in a critical or questioning context rather than promoting hate or offense.

3. There are no direct attacks or promotion of hate against any group. The tweet is more focused on perceived hypocrisy among political groups.

4. The tone seems more inquisitive and critical of past reactions rather than intending to incite anger or promote harm.

Here's an analysis:

1. The label ""normal"" would imply that the text is neutral or lacks controversial content. However, this text contains strong accusations of sexual abuse, rape, and paedophilia within Westminster and the ""paki community."" Such serious allegations suggest it should be classified as either ""hate speech"" or at least ""offensive.""

2. Key features supporting a non-neutral classification include references to sensitive issues like paedophilia, sexual abuse, and rape, which are neither neutral nor harmless topics. The language used is also quite strong and inflammatory, with phrases like ""complete fucking lie,"" which further detracts from any claim of normalcy.

3. While the target groups (Arab, None) might seem unrelated to the content, the mention of ""paki community"" does suggest an intended audience or group being referenced in a negative light. This could potentially categorize it as hate speech if the intent was to vilify this community specifically. However, without clearer evidence of direct targeting based on ethnicity or religion, it may be more appropriate to classify it as ""offensive.""

4. The tone is accusatory and angry, suggesting an intent to expose perceived injustices or cover-ups around serious criminal activities. While the user's motivations can't be definitively gauged from this short excerpt alone, the inflammatory language does convey a sense of righteous indignation.

5. In conclusion, while the text contains no explicit slurs or openly bigoted statements, the combination of grave allegations, strong profanity, and implied government/media malfeasance related to horrific crimes makes it difficult to justify classifying it as ""normal."" A more fitting classification would likely be ""offensive,"" with the potential for ""hate speech"" depending on additional context around the specific targets and intent.

- By using such inflammatory language and promoting division based on race, it incites hatred and violence towards African people.

- Terms like ""queer"" are used in a self-referential way without pejorative intent, indicating the speaker's own identity rather than an attack on others.

**Label Implication**: The classification of ""hate speech"" indicates that the text contains language or sentiments that express prejudice, hostility, or promote violence against a specific group.

**Key Features Analysis**: The term ""niglet"" is an extremely derogatory and racist slur targeting young African-American males. Its use in conjunction with describing someone being caught with a knife intensifies the hate speech element by perpetuating negative stereotypes of criminality associated with this demographic.

**Target Group Impact**: The text specifically targets African, Men by using inflammatory language that suggests inherent violent tendencies based solely on race and age (""niglet""). This not only promotes bigotry but also encourages others to perceive this group through a lens of suspicion and fear.

**Context and Tone Assessment**: The context of the tweet involves an incident at a school, which further escalates the potential harm of such speech. The speculative nature of the text (""how many would bet it"") coupled with the pejorative term creates an environment that normalizes racist assumptions about who might commit such acts.

**Conclusion Justification**: This classification is justified by the clear presence of a severe racial slur directed towards young African-American males, embedded within a narrative that implies criminal behavior based on race. The language used and the context provided contribute to an atmosphere that promotes prejudice and hostility against the targeted group, aligning with the definition of hate speech.",31.61,"[ 4.9371953  -1.077178    3.799474   ...  3.397928   -1.5324694

3. Target group: The target group is not explicitly mentioned, but given the context of K-pop groups BTS and SuperM, it seems to be directed at fans of these bands.
4. Context and tone: The tweet appears to be sharing information or personal preferences regarding different song or album versions. The tone is neutral without any aggressive or inflammatory language.

The phrase ""ass hamad an"" appears to be a distorted or slang reference, possibly aimed at specific individuals or groups associated with Islam.

The phrase directly targets two groups, Caucasians and women, by combining a derogatory term for women (""bitches"") with a reference to race (""white""). This combination serves to promote bigotry and hostility towards these groups.

However, upon analysis, the content contains explicit sexual references and engages in a tit-for-tat exchange of provocative imagery between different ethnic groups.

Key points:
- The tweet mentions finding ""the same gif with a black couple"" to respond to a white couple's sexual content.
- It employs explicit language and sexual terms in reference to the gifs shared.
- Despite the seemingly retaliatory nature, it lacks direct hate speech or targeted harassment based on ethnicity.
- It does however create an environment of discomfort and potential offense due to its graphic subject matter.

While not overtly promoting violence or targeting a group with hate, the tweet's explicit content and provocative exchange could be seen as offending norms. Yet, it stops short of clear abuse/harassment or direct incitement of hate. The context suggests an attempt at humorous retaliation rather than malicious intent towards any group.

In conclusion, while containing explicit sexual references and engaging in a potentially inflammatory exchange across ethnic lines, the tweet avoids direct hate speech or harassment. Its classification leans towards normal due to its retaliatory nature without clear malice, but it teeters on the edge of offensiveness given the graphic subject matter and tit-for-tat provocation involving race.",25.21,"[ 7.0116043  -0.50969076  0.6657378  ...  5.2134914  -4.334091

These terms are not only abusive but also serve to dehumanize the target by questioning their rights and the legitimacy of their inclusion in societal norms.

1. The classification of 'normal' implies that while the language used may be strong or critical, it does not rise to the level of hate speech or direct offense against a protected group.
2. The key features in this context are the use of strong language (""asshole"") and references to political affiliations (""top ranking white house nazi""). While these terms are harsh, they do not directly target a specific ethnic, religious, or social group with the intent to harm or incite violence.
3. The target identified is ""Caucasian"", but in this context, it appears more related to a political opinion or viewpoint rather than targeting an individual based on their race. There's no direct link between the criticism and the person's ethnicity.
4. The tone of the text suggests personal frustration or dislike (""he blocked me""), which indicates a specific interpersonal issue rather than systemic bigotry or prejudice.

3. By using this term, the text targets African Americans in a highly offensive manner, intending to demean and insult.

- The tweet's use of the term ""niglets"" is a clear marker of hate speech, as it's an extremely derogatory and dehumanizing slur against black children. This term sets a hostile and prejudiced tone.
  
- By contrasting ""niglets with cancer"" to ""white kids,"" the text establishes a racial dichotomy that suggests an inherent superiority or preferential treatment towards one group over another based solely on race.

- The reference to ""mr taylor"" doing more for white children further promotes a narrative of segregated philanthropy, insinuating that efforts to aid sick African children are undeserving of support.

- The tweet's context and tone reveal an intent to denigrate and express contempt towards African people, especially children suffering from cancer.

The tweet contains extremely inflammatory language and baseless accusations that promote animosity against specific ethnic and religious groups. Key features such as ""smelly Paki filth"" and references to sexual violence against ""British girls"" reveal a clear intent to incite hatred.

- The term ""Paki"" is a known slur used to denigrate individuals of Pakistani origin, which is coupled here with the adjective ""smelly,"" further emphasizing a dehumanizing sentiment.
  
- The accusation that these individuals are responsible for raping and abusing British girls plays into dangerous and unfounded stereotypes, leveraging sensitive issues for the purpose of provoking hostility.

- The targeting extends beyond just ethnicity by also implicating the British government (specifically, the Prime Minister) as being complicit through inaction, due to distractions caused by geopolitical conflicts with Russia.

- The pejorative slur ""kike"", an overtly anti-Semitic term used to offend and demean Jewish individuals.

The tweet appears to be criticizing Eli Lake, with the user taking issue with his supposed disingenuous support for Trump.

- Usage of informal language (""nigga"", ""join the club"") which, although potentially controversial, is not used in a directly hateful manner.
- Discussion of personal experience (being a ""sex addict since junior high"") which is shared between the speaker and A$AP Rocky rather than targeting anyone.

Label: normal

Explanation:
- The text, while criticizing a group (""white fascists""), does not directly engage in hate speech. It questions the tactics of this group and points out irony in their behavior.
- Key features include references to ""white fascists"", ""immigrants"", and ""jews will not replace us"". However, these are used critically rather than endorsing their views.
- The target is unclear, but the tweet seems to respond to an accusation of projection by highlighting perceived hypocrisy.
- Despite discussing sensitive topics, the tweet refrains from directly promoting hate or using explicitly derogatory language.

Conclusion:
The tweet falls into the ""normal"" category. While it tackles contentious subjects and criticizes a group, its argumentative tone stops short of endorsing hate or employing blatantly offensive terms. The user seems to be calling out perceived hypocrisy rather than inciting hate or harm against any specific group.",22.95,"[-2.624316   -0.9475365  -0.70287067 ...  8.111801   -2.3546126

However, it's crucial to recognize that the use of the term ""retarded"" in this context can be seen as insensitive and potentially offensive towards individuals with disabilities.

Key features contributing to this classification include:
- The informal tone which suggests a casual usage rather than deliberate malice.
- The lack of a clear target or intent to harm. 

Considering the user's self-deprecating humor, there isn't an explicit attack on any group. Yet, the language used could still perpetuate negative stereotypes about intellectual disabilities.

The key features, both instances of the word ""bitches,"" emphasize the negative portrayal of women, implying that they are lazy and unhygienic. 

This classification is further justified by the tweet's overall tone, which appears to be mocking and derisive towards its female target group. By suggesting that women prefer shopping at Bath & Body Works to maintaining personal hygiene and going to work, it perpetuates negative stereotypes about women's priorities and work ethic.

In conclusion, the tweet's classification as offensive is supported by its use of explicit misogynistic language and the propagation of demeaning generalizations about women's behavior.

1. The tweet contains language that can be seen as offensive towards Caucasians by generalizing their behavior as rude and racist. Phrases like ""white people being rude,"" ""being racist,"" and ""looking down on Asians"" contribute to this classification.

2. Key features include the use of explicit language (""fking mad""), which adds to the tweet's aggressive tone. The tweet also makes broad, negative generalizations about a specific racial group (Caucasians), further supporting its classification as offensive.

3. The target groups are Caucasians and Asians. The tweet accuses an entire race (Caucasians) of racism and disrespect towards another race (Asians). This not only offends the targeted Caucasian group but also indirectly insults the Asian community by suggesting they are routinely disrespected.

4. The tone is confrontational, using ""lmfao"" (an acronym for 'laughing my f*cking ass off'), which indicates a mocking and dismissive attitude. This further supports the classification of the text as offensive.

5. In conclusion, due to its use of explicit language, negative generalizations about an entire race, and confrontational tone, this tweet should be classified as ""offensive"" rather than ""normal.""",30.71,"[ 3.7409983   2.1102648  -0.12736785 ...  7.411286   -0.9278903

While it describes an altercation involving a person wearing a ""white trash crew"" shirt and another couple, these terms alone don't constitute hate speech. The incident revolves around a trivial issue - feeding a potato chip to a dog, suggesting the situation is more of a personal dispute than systemic prejudice.

The key phrase ""white trash crew"" could be seen as mildly pejorative but lacks clear malice or intent to harm. No direct slurs or language demeaning protected groups are used. The term doesn't overtly link to hate ideologies.

The post's tone seems more amused than hostile, recounting an unusual incident without apparent anger or advocacy of violence/prejudice. 

In conclusion, while the phrase ""white trash crew"" has negative connotations, its usage here lacks clear hate speech indicators. No specific group is demeaned based on protected characteristics like race, religion, etc. The context suggests a personal conflict over an everyday issue rather than targeted bigotry, so a normal classification is warranted based on this analysis of the language and tone.",25.12,[ 0.6953308  2.4199634 -3.8100128 ... 11.498307  -2.3224905 -0.866074 ],1, normal

The reference to historical events where Spanish and Portuguese authorities expelled these groups adds an additional layer of hostility. By citing such occurrences in a positive light, the user is endorsing past acts of religious persecution. The overall tone is mocking and dismissive, further amplifying the demeaning impact on the targeted groups.

The target of this text is clearly the Jewish community, with the language used serving to perpetuate negative stereotypes and incite animosity. The tone of the message conveys a disregard for the dignity and respect due to members of the targeted group.

This text specifically targets people of African descent, employing language that denies their humanity and reduces them to mere objects or stereotypes based on physical characteristics. Moreover, by contrasting ""us chubby men"", the author creates an us-versus-them dichotomy, further alienating and demeaning the targeted group.

The tone is dismissive and contemptuous, revealing a clear intent to degrade and insult. The context implies that the so-called 'skinny niggers' are somehow inferior or less valuable because they can be 'swayed by the wind', a metaphor perhaps implying weakness or vulnerability. This sentiment exacerbates the offense, as it not only insults but also mocks the target group.

The tweet offensively generalizes the elderly demographic, accusing them of being the ""meanest"" and highlighting specific negative behaviors they supposedly exhibit more than any other group. The use of slurs adds to the offense, contributing to a tone that demeans the targeted group.

Despite acknowledging some positive aspects (like baking), the overall message is negative and derisory towards the elderly. It suggests an undeserved courtesy given to them due to their age while emphasizing negative stereotypes.

The tweet targets the homosexual community by using a term that demeans and marginalizes them. The context implies that the user is critical of others for promoting content related to same-sex attraction (fancams) and attempting to increase their following by openly expressing their sexual orientation, thus revealing a prejudiced mindset.

Considering the tone and intent behind the choice of words, it's clear the user aims to belittle and disparage individuals who openly identify as lesbians or are supportive of same-sex relationships. Such language can contribute to a hostile environment that fosters homophobia and discourages open expression of sexual orientation.

The use of terms such as ""low iq,"" ""bottom feeder,"" ""trailer trash"" serve to further demean and degrade the target, reinforcing the hate speech label by adding a layer of class-based prejudice.

Additionally, the reference to ""snow"" is likely an abbreviation for ""snow nigger,"" an even more derogatory term that combines racism with mocking the target's perceived intelligence or economic status.

The text targets multiple groups - African, Caucasian, Indigenous, and others - compounding its hate speech classification by promoting animosity and superiority amongst these groups.

Explanation: While this text does contain derogatory language towards African Americans with the use of the racial slur ""nigger,"" it is not explicitly directed at a specific individual or group. Instead, the text seems to be expressing frustration and resentment more broadly towards individuals perceived as being unintelligent, low-class, or undesirable. The reference to slavery and past white men may also imply a broader critique of systemic inequalities rather than a targeted attack on African Americans.

- The tweet suggests eliminating a specific group (""illegal aliens"") and attributes numerous societal problems to them. This promotes a hostile and discriminatory environment against immigrants.
- Key features include the phrase ""eliminated the illegal aliens,"" which advocates for removal of undocumented immigrants, and the subsequent claims that this would result in cleaner roads, fewer child rape cases, fewer drunk drivers, and rising wages for citizens. These statements unjustly blame a vulnerable group for various societal ills.
- The target group is clearly defined as ""Other, Refugee"", indicating that the hate speech is directed at undocumented immigrants, refugees, or people of other nationalities.
- The tone is aggressive and dehumanizing, with the user presenting a hypothetical scenario where the elimination of this group would lead to an improvement in society. This kind of language can incite violence or prejudiced actions against the targeted community.

3. **Target Group Impact**: Although the term ""muzrat"" could be considered derogatory, its usage within the context of conveying someone else's viewpoint dilutes potential offensiveness.

4. **Context and Tone Evaluation**:
   - The user seems to critique a perspective that normalizes terrorism in certain cities. They highlight the absence of outrage or commitment to combat it, suggesting a disapproval.

The tweet text ""bunch of queers"" employs the term ""queers,"" which is a derogatory slur aimed at individuals identifying as homosexual.

1. **Label Implication**: The label 'normal' suggests that the text, despite expressing strong political opinions, does not cross into hate speech or overtly offensive territory.

2. **Key Features Analysis**:
   - Strong language: Words like ""arse licking"" and ""bloody socialist"" indicate a high level of hostility and disrespect in the text.
   - Political slurs: Terms such as ""sjw"", ""cultural marxist"", and ""europhile remoaner"" are politically charged slurs that contribute to an aggressive tone.
   
3. **Target Group Impact**:
   - Islam: The term ""moslem loving"" is used pejoratively, suggesting a negative stance towards Islam or those perceived as favoring it.
   - Refugees/Immigrants: The phrase ""immigrant arse licking"" uses dehumanizing language to express disdain for refugees or immigrants.

4. **Context and Tone Analysis**:
   - Hostile tone: The overall aggressive tone could be seen as promoting conflict rather than constructive debate.
   - Political context: References to Brexit, socialism, and conservatism place this in a highly politicized framework, which may account for the heightened rhetoric.

5. **Conclusion**:
   While containing hostile language and political slurs, the text does not directly incite violence or use explicitly dehumanizing terms typical of hate speech. Its aggressive tone is largely confined to the political realm, criticizing perceived leftist policies rather than targeting protected groups with outright hate. Thus, while inflammatory, it narrowly avoids crossing into 'hate speech' territory and could be argued as 'offensive' due to its derisory language towards certain political stances associated with marginalized groups. However, given the context of heated but ostensibly non-violent political discourse, a classification of 'normal' is defensible based on the framework provided.",38.58,[-0.7433961  4.043295  -2.0755155 ...  4.3901644  3.4392223  1.5026776],1," offensive. The text contains derogatory language towards various groups, including Muslims and political ideologies.

Key features such as the directive to ""kill"" combined with the n-word demonstrate a clear intent to incite harm against African individuals, specifically infants in this case. The dehumanizing language and call to prenatal violence underscore the intense bigotry behind it.

The context is one of aggressive racism rather than mere offensiveness - the tweet goes beyond insulting a group to advocating for actual physical attacks based on race. Its use of graphic violent imagery along with a vicious ethnic epithet place it firmly in the hate speech category.

4. The context appears to be a domestic situation involving family members rather than a broader social or political issue.

The tweet's language creates a hostile environment by degrading a group based on race. Despite the author's claim of being focused on facts and truths, the use of such inflammatory terms undermines any substantive argument and shifts the focus to the hatefulness of the language itself.

This text is not just an isolated incident but part of a larger pattern where certain words are used to perpetuate harm against specific communities. The context reveals that the intent was likely to offend or provoke outrage rather than engage in constructive dialogue, which further reinforces its classification as hate speech.

3. While the repetition of ""stefan molyneux too many"" could imply a critical stance, it doesn't cross into clear hate speech territory.

Explanation:
The text ""Stefan Molyneux too many gay people Stefan Molyneux too many women Stefan Molyneux too many leftists Stefan Molyneux too many liberals Stefan Molyneux too many transgender Stefan Molyneux too many moslems I can continue but that might take a while I am afraid"" is offensive because it repeatedly mentions various groups in a negative manner without any clear reason or justification. The tone of the text is one of disdain and intolerance towards these groups, which could be perceived as hateful or discriminatory by some people. However, it does not directly call for harm or violence against anyone, so it does not qualify as hate speech in its most extreme form.

While the term ""retarded"" can be considered ableist and potentially offensive when used in a derogatory manner, it appears here more as unthinking insults among individuals, without clear intent to promote hate or widespread offense against a group. The context lacks other hallmarks of hate speech like larger ideological motivations or calls to action.

The classification leans on the absence of organized incitement to harm or attack people based on their identity. It reflects common online jargon, crude but not necessarily indicative of deeper prejudice. While ideally discouraged for its ableist connotations and personal offensiveness, this single instance doesn't meet thresholds for broader hate speech.

In conclusion, ""retarded"" is a red flag term, but surrounding context shows this as more immature name-calling than coordinated bigotry or harassment.

The tweet criticizes a Futurama episode for its depiction of gang violence, calling it stereotypical and ignorant. Despite the strong language used (""reaching too hard"", ""needs to be banned""), the criticism is directed towards the content creators and not any specific group. 

Key features supporting this classification:
- No direct or indirect targeting of any group.
- Critique is aimed at media representation rather than a real-world entity.
- Use of terms like ""stereotypical"" and ""ignorant"", while strong, do not cross into hate speech or severe offensiveness.

The tweet's target appears to be the Futurama episode itself and by extension its creators. There are no identifiable groups targeted in the text. 

In evaluating the context and tone, it's clear that the user is expressing a strongly negative opinion about the content of the episode. However, this falls within the bounds of protected free speech as there is no incitement to violence or hate.

In conclusion, while the tweet contains strong language criticizing an aspect of media representation, it does not rise to the level of hate speech or even offensiveness due to its focus on a fictional work and lack of direct targeting towards any group.

2. It mentions the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), a major political party in India.
3. The phrase ""illegal Muslim immigrant from Bangladesh"" might be seen as controversial but is presented here in a political context without overt bigotry.

While the topic is sensitive and could potentially incite division, the tweet itself does not directly insult or promote hatred against any group. It's primarily expressing an opinion on a political decision related to immigration.

Explanation: The user's statement implies that homosexuality is undesirable in South Carolina, and then makes a comparison between it and pedophilia, which is a serious crime and societal taboo. The statement also includes a racial component by stating that fathering a black child would be less concerning than homosexuality. This statement targets multiple communities (LGBTQ+ and Black people) with derogatory and discriminatory language, creating a hostile environment for these groups.

Although it contains strong language (e.g., ""fucking hate group""), this alone does not necessarily classify it as hate speech. The key phrase here is ""hate group"", which suggests the user's disagreement or disapproval towards a specific entity they perceive as promoting hate.

However, without more context about what group is being referred to and why the user considers them a ""hate group"", it's challenging to definitively label this text as hate speech. The lack of specific targets or slurs directed at protected groups makes it difficult to categorize it beyond ""offensive"" due to its strong language.

In conclusion, while the language is strong and could be considered offensive, there isn't enough evidence within the provided text to classify it as hate speech. The user seems to be expressing frustration about perceived hypocrisy but without explicitly promoting violence or attacking a specific group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, religion).

1. **Label Implication**: The classification of ""normal"" indicates the tweet does not contain overtly hostile or offensive content.

2. **Key Features Analysis**: The key features are not explicitly provided, but the overall tone seems to question the sincerity of those welcoming refugees without taking any in themselves. This skepticism alone doesn't render the text as hate speech or even strictly offensive.

3. **Impact on Target Group**: While the tweet is critical of individuals or groups who express support for refugees, it does so by questioning their commitment rather than attacking them directly. The critique focuses on perceived hypocrisy and not on any inherent qualities of the target group that would classify this as hate speech or inherently offensive.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**: The context appears to be a discussion around refugee policies or debates. The tone is critical but lacks clear indicators of malice or direct insult, maintaining a more general critique rather than personalized attack.

5. **Conclusion Justifying Classification**: Although the tweet expresses skepticism towards certain activists' sincerity, it does not employ language that is explicitly abusive, threatening, or derogatory towards any group based on protected characteristics like race, religion, etc., which would be necessary for categorizing it as hate speech or even strictly offensive. The critique, while potentially controversial in sentiment, remains within the bounds of public discourse and doesn't cross into outright hostility.

1. The label 'offensive' implies that the language used in the text is vulgar or rude and may cause offense or distress to others, particularly to the targeted group.

2. Key features supporting this classification include the use of derogatory terms such as ""hoe"", which is a highly provocative and demeaning slang term for women. This word choice reveals the speaker's disdain and contributes significantly to the text's offensive nature.

3. The target of the text is women, specifically mothers, who are disparaged through the claim that the referred woman is a ""bad mom"". This further intensifies the offense by suggesting poor parenting based on unmentioned criteria, which could be deeply insulting to the subject of the statement and other women or mothers who may read it.

4. The context and tone are dismissive and mocking, as indicated by the laughter emoji at the end. This suggests that the user is ridiculing the subject, compounding the offense with a lack of empathy or seriousness towards the potentially damaging accusations made.

2. **Key Features Analysis**: There are no explicit key features provided that would indicate hate speech or offense. The tweet mentions multiple users but doesn't employ derogatory terms, slurs, or negative stereotypes.

3. **Impact on Target Group**: Since no specific target group is mentioned, and the context does not allude to any particular community or individual in a negative light, there's no evident harm directed towards a specific audience.

2. The key features - ""bitches"" and ""niggas"" - are derogatory terms that carry negative connotations and historical oppression towards women and Black individuals, respectively. Their use contributes significantly to the offensiveness of the text.

1. The tweet is discussing the pronunciation of a French term ""nonrefoulement,"" which in itself does not contain any inherently negative or controversial content.
2. The user mentions having consulted with refugee rights experts, indicating an intent to correctly pronounce and understand the term rather than to offend or deride.

3. There is no identifiable target group that is being negatively impacted by this text. 

4. While the user finds humor in a hearing discussion about pronunciation (""lol""), there's no indication of mockery directed towards any specific individual or group based on their identity, beliefs, or attributes.

5. The tone appears to be light-hearted and informative rather than aggressive or insulting.

In conclusion, despite some potential confusion regarding pronunciation, this tweet is classified as normal because it lacks any clear intent to harm, offend, or promote animosity against a target group, and instead reflects an attempt at education or clarification on the correct pronunciation of a foreign term.",22.42,[ 5.941478   3.487506  -4.4881887 ...  5.1636095  3.9381144  3.8858857],1, normal

1. While the language used in this tweet may be considered crude or vulgar by some due to the use of profanity (e.g., ""fucking""), it does not target any specific group based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, etc.

2. The key feature here is the accusation that someone (""the loud white dude"") might be an undercover law enforcement agent or informant (""fed""). However, this accusation alone does not make the tweet inherently hate speech or even necessarily offensive.

3. There is no clear target group referenced in the text beyond a single individual who is being accused of something based on their behavior (being loud) and race (white). This alone would not be sufficient to classify the text as hate speech, which typically involves broader generalizations or vilification of an entire group.

4. The tone is informal and colloquial rather than menacing or aggressively hostile. While it expresses strong suspicion or dislike towards a specific individual, this does not extend to any wider group based on protected characteristics.

5. In conclusion, despite the crude language used, the tweet lacks the key elements that would categorize it as hate speech or even broadly offensive: absence of attacking or marginalizing a protected group, lack of intent to promote violence or discrimination, and a context suggesting personal animosity rather than systemic bigotry.

3. The user's intent seems to be criticizing or mocking another user for their apparent condoning of drug use. However, by using such a strongly negative ethnic slur, the user turns a criticism into an act of hate.
4. While the main topic is drug use, it becomes overshadowed by the inflammatory language used. This combination of controversial subject matter and highly charged, targeted insult creates an environment of offense.

The use of ""us"" versus ""you"" rhetoric creates an in-group versus out-group dynamic that is a hallmark of hate speech.

1. **Label Implication**: The classification of this text as ""normal"" implies it lacks explicitly hateful or highly offensive content targeting specific groups.

2. **Key Features Analysis**:
   - Terms like ""magic dirt theory"", ""radical muzzie"", and mentioning nationality and religion could be seen as potential indicators of hate speech or offensiveness.
   
3. **Target Group Impact**: 
    - The text references Islam and the individual involved in an attack, which could be perceived as perpetuating stereotypes about Muslims and linking them to violent acts.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**:
   - While the language used is critical and possibly inflammatory, it falls short of clear incitement or direct, extreme vilification that would categorize it as hate speech.
   
5. **Conclusion Justifying Classification**: 
    - Although containing potentially loaded terms regarding religion and national origin, this tweet's classification leans toward ""normal"" due to its focus on criticizing a theory rather than directly attacking or demeaning the targeted groups.
    
In summary, while the text contains language that could be considered inflammatory when referring to sensitive subjects like religion and nationality, it doesn't cross the threshold into explicit hate speech.

The tweet text ""fuck off nigger"" is unequivocally classified as hate speech due to its usage of a highly offensive and provocative term targeting individuals of African descent. 

Key features such as the explicit phrase ""fuck off"" combined with the derogatory slur ""nigger"" are clear indicators of this classification. These terms express intense animosity and disrespect towards the targeted group, contributing significantly to the inflammatory nature of the text.

The tweet directly targets individuals of African heritage by employing one of the most potent slurs in the English language, which has deep historical roots in oppression and dehumanization.

However, it does touch upon sensitive topics like race and ethnicity in a somewhat light-hearted manner.

Key features supporting this classification include:

- The user acknowledges the complexity of ethnic identities by pointing out someone can be both Latina and white. This adds nuance to the conversation rather than promoting hostility.
- There's no direct attack or inflammatory language aimed at any specific group.

The text's reference to ""nigga"" might be seen as problematic, but in this context it seems more likely to be quoting or referencing someone else’s speech rather than using the term aggressively.

The text appears to be a quote or reference to someone named ""Ay"" stating that an African individual is giving away free money. While the language used in mentioning the person of African descent is extremely problematic and could be deemed as hate speech, this particular instance seems to be a direct quote or mention without any apparent malicious intent.

Key Features: 
- The use of a racial slur against the African target
- However, it's unclear whether this language comes directly from the author of the tweet or is being quoted. 

Target Group:
- The text refers to an African individual using highly derogatory language.

Analysis:
- It seems likely that the tweet is quoting someone else's statement rather than espousing hate speech itself. 
- While the content is distasteful due to the slur, without further context it doesn't appear to be promoting hatred.
- If this were a direct expression of the author, it would definitely qualify as hate speech.

Conclusion:
Based on these factors, the classification of ""normal"" seems incorrect and potentially misleading. The tweet's use of a severe racial slur is highly problematic regardless of intent or attribution. While not enough context is provided to label it definitively as hate speech, classifying it as merely normal ignores the very real offense caused by this language.

The tweet text ""she a he and it a kike"" employs the term ""kike,"" which is an egregious slur directed at Jewish individuals. This classification as hate speech is supported by:

1. **Key Features**: The use of the word 'kike,' a highly derogatory term for Jews, is central to understanding why this text qualifies as hate speech.

2. **Target Group**: By specifically using a slur against Jewish people and referring to them in a dehumanizing manner (""it""), the tweet targets both the Jewish community and challenges traditional gender identities in a negative context.

3. **Tone and Intent**: The language is intentionally demeaning, indicating an intent to belittle or harm the targeted group through the use of abusive terminology.

4. **Contextual Impact**: In any context, using slurs like ""kike"" serves no constructive purpose and only functions to propagate animosity towards the mentioned community.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the term 'kike' is a deeply offensive slur targeting Jewish individuals and is used here in conjunction with dehumanizing pronoun usage (""it""), this text unequivocally falls into the category of hate speech. Its sole function appears to be the denigration of both Jewish people and those who may not conform to binary gender norms, reinforcing its classification as such.",29.9,[-1.3026559  4.845364   3.4937549 ... 10.411963  -4.6094394  4.4440145],0," offensive.

The tweet implies that certain conditions (""very post wall"") could lead to a change in sexual orientation, furthering the offense by perpetuating stereotypes and misunderstandings about homosexuality. This speculative assertion attacks the individual's autonomy over their sexual identity and propagates a bigoted view of sexual orientation as something that can be influenced by external factors or life stages.

This term is a severe racial slur used primarily against African Americans, carrying historical connotations of hatred and oppression.

The key feature supporting this classification is the outright usage of ""nigger"", which is universally recognized as inflammatory and racially charged language. The tweet's target appears to be a specific person within the context of a broader ethnic group, making the insult not just personal but also directed at an entire race.

Although the user claims Alex as their friend, the choice of such an aggressive term undermines this assertion and reveals a hostile intent. The slur's presence in the sentence negates any possibility of interpreting the message as benign or neutral due to its extreme offensiveness.

- The word ""moslem"" is an intentional misspelling of 'Muslim,' indicating bigotry.
- Mentioning ""refugee ban"" in the context of correcting something, implying refugees are problematic.

These elements collectively create a hostile tone targeting liberals, Muslims, and refugees. 

The text's intent appears to be criticizing legal setbacks to a refugee ban, with the speaker blaming these groups for perceived problems.

The term 'niggas' is a racial slur directed at African people, 'pussy' is an insult implying weakness, often used against those who do not conform to traditional masculine norms, and 'faggots' is a homophobic slur.

It presents an opinion on a political issue without resorting to hate speech or overt offensiveness.

Key features supporting this classification:
- The tweet does not contain any slurs, explicit insults, or language that could be deemed highly provocative.
- While it criticizes a political viewpoint (""conflation of immigrants with minorities""), it does so in a measured tone without attacking a specific group.

The text's impact on the target audience:
- It is unclear what specific group may be targeted. The tweet seems to address a broad political ideology rather than a particular demographic.
- The language used is more analytical than inflammatory, suggesting an intent to discuss and critique rather than offend or incite hatred.

Summary:
This classification stems from the use of inflammatory language and broad generalizations targeting a specific group - in this case, Caucasian individuals associated with what the author perceives as negative global events.

Key Features Discussion:
- The phrase ""what the devil created white people"" employs demonic terminology to demonize an entire race.
- The reference to ""white devil armies of trump"" conflates political ideology with race and implies malicious intent based on skin color.
- Terms like ""murdering"", ""killing"", ""slaughtering"" used in conjunction with ""dark-skinned"" individuals suggest a racial motive behind these acts.

Impact on Target Group:
The language used is aggressive, painting an entire group as inherently evil. This could incite real-world violence or discrimination against Caucasians by portraying them as global aggressors and linking them to satanic forces.

Tone and Intent Assessment: 
The author's intent seems to be vilifying a race by associating it with evil acts. The tone is highly charged, inflammatory, and hostile. 

Conclusion:
Given the demonizing language, generalizations about an entire group based on skin color, and accusations of global atrocities, this text unequivocally meets the criteria for hate speech. It employs inflammatory rhetoric to promote animosity towards a targeted demographic group.",29.67,"[ 1.1137761   0.01503118 -1.2826699  ...  8.681275    3.776757

The tweet discusses an intriguing cultural observation about identity among Sicilian Italians. It shares a personal anecdote of conversations with multiple individuals from this group who apparently do not self-identify as white due to historical African presence on the island.

Key features supporting this classification:
1. The text describes a conversation topic without expressing any hate or offense towards the discussed group.
2. Terms used are descriptive and not intended to insult or demean.
3. It conveys an observation about cultural identity, which is neutral in nature.

Impact on target group: 
The tweet doesn't disparage Sicilian Italians but presents their perspective on racial identity. The tone is more curious than critical, suggesting the user finds this viewpoint interesting rather than objectionable.

Context and Tone:
The casual language (""deadass"", ""I am not fucking kidding"") suggests informal conversation-style sharing of a personal experience. It lacks hostility or aggression associated with hate speech or overt offensiveness.

- The language used is blatantly hostile and inflammatory, intending to incite violence or perpetuate negative stereotypes about the target community.

The phrase ""bum bitch"" also has negative connotations.
- Despite these elements, the tweet lacks clear context to determine if it's specifically targeting or threatening any group. Without this contextual understanding, classifying it as hate speech would be premature.
- However, the language used could still be deeply offensive to many readers due to its charged nature and potential to perpetuate negative stereotypes.

Conclusion: While not explicitly hate speech due to insufficient context, the tweet is highly problematic because of its use of inflammatory language. The classification of ""normal"" doesn't account for how this kind of language can contribute to a hostile environment and promote marginalization.

- It connects this early-life abuse to patterns in later romantic partnerships.
- While disturbing, it doesn't employ slurs or target protected groups.
- The intent seems to be sharing personal insight rather than inciting harm.

1. The phrase ""white ass names"" carries an inherently negative tone.
2. Key features: The combination of ""white ass"" modifies ""names"", implying a derogatory stance towards names associated with white individuals. While no specific slurs are used, the phrase still conveys disrespect and perpetuates stereotypes.
3. Target group: Caucasian people are indirectly targeted by the pejorative phrasing.
4. Intent: Given the absence of additional context, it's challenging to determine the user's exact intent. However, the phrase itself carries an undermining tone, suggesting a dismissive or mocking attitude towards the names of white individuals.

Conclusion:

The use of this provocative and inflammatory language, combined with the negative characterization of 'rap' music as 'shit', reveals a strong animosity towards both the musical genre associated with African American culture and the community itself.

The inclusion of the word 'nigger' is central to classifying this text as hate speech. This term has historically been used to demean and dehumanize black individuals, carrying with it a legacy of oppression and violence. Its presence in the tweet, coupled with the dismissal and denigration of an entire musical genre closely tied to African American expression, underscores a deep-seated bigotry.

The target of this hate speech is clearly the African American community, as evidenced by the specific use of 'nigger' and the negative reference to rap music which has its roots in African American culture. The tweet does not contribute to any form of meaningful discourse but serves only to spread vitriol and animosity towards a marginalized group.

Considering the historical weight and current societal implications of the language used, the intent appears to be to degrade and insult, revealing prejudice and hostility. Therefore, this text is classified as hate speech due to its use of a severe racial epithet, the targeting of an ethnic group through cultural denigration, and the clear absence of any constructive purpose or context that could mitigate its offensiveness.

In conclusion, the tweet's classification as hate speech is justified by the presence of extremely derogatory language ('nigger'), the negative and dismissive reference to a musical genre associated with African American culture ('rap shit'), and the overt targeting of an ethnic group ('African').

Moreover, the statement ""tryna low ball me like he do not be with them rich white folks"" suggests that the author perceives the individual as attempting to undervalue or deceive them.

1. The label's implication: The text uses language that can be considered demeaning and dismissive towards a specific demographic group (young Caucasian females), hence the classification.

2. Key features supporting this classification:
   - Use of ""white young females"" specifically targets a demographic.
   - ""Hoes mad"" is a slang term, often used to express frustration or anger, which in this context seems to demean and trivialize the serious medical condition mentioned (migraines).

3. Impact on or reference to target group:
   - The text makes a speculative and stereotypical correlation between being female and experiencing migraines.
   
4. Context and tone assessment:
   - The overall tone is informal and dismissive, potentially contributing to an environment of casual misogyny.

5. Conclusion justifying the classification:
   - The tweet targets Caucasian women with migraine conditions in a derisory manner, trivializing both their medical issues and identities, thus qualifying it as offensive.",24.84,"[ 0.25954908  5.718964   -0.3830513  ...  6.1058826  -4.478969

1. The label 'normal' suggests that the text does not contain explicit hate speech or highly offensive content.

2. Although there are no key features listed, the phrase ""hey gay people"" could potentially be seen as targeting a specific group. However, in this context, it seems to be expressing support for their right to march and exercise their freedoms in a free country. The inclusion of the emoji at the end further suggests a positive or light-hearted tone.

3. There is no clear target specified beyond ""gay people,"" who are referenced in what appears to be a supportive manner rather than a hostile or aggressive one.

4. Assessing the context and tone, while direct, the message seems to affirm the rights of gay individuals to express themselves freely in a democratic society. It does not contain overtly negative or inflammatory language typically associated with hate speech or highly offensive content.

5. In conclusion, based on the apparent supportive sentiment, lack of clearly hostile or aggressive language, and the general context suggesting affirmation of rights in a free society, the classification of 'normal' is justified for this text.

1. The text discusses sensitive social topics like race and sexual orientation in a somewhat dismissive manner.
2. It uses strong language (e.g., ""fucking"") which some may find abrasive or vulgar.

However, key points supporting its neutral classification include:
- Lack of direct targeting or malice towards any particular group.
- Seemingly casual tone and context focused on a mundane scenario (traffic lights).
- Intent appears to be humor or frustration rather than promoting hate or offense.

Explanation: The text contains an expression of frustration, using strong language and an inappropriate metaphor that may be considered offensive to some people due to the reference to stopping at a yellow light. However, this text does not contain any explicit hate speech or targeting towards specific groups based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.

The related examples provided serve as helpful context in understanding the nuances of language and intent. The first example, ""i want to be the dyke priest,"" is a self-referential statement expressing personal desire that lacks explicit harm, hostility, or targeted offense towards any particular community. The second example, ""white people say they have dark humour and then just call you a nigger and laugh it off bc they have black friends,"" critiques the behavior of individuals who use prejudiced language in humor, but does not engage in hate speech itself.

In contrast, the user input text, ""it's okay to be white, black, straight or gay but it is not okay for you to stop at a yellow light when we both could have fucking made it,"" uses strong and offensive language that may be perceived as disrespectful and inappropriate towards others. However, the text does not explicitly target any particular group, nor does it contain hate speech, making its classification as ""offensive"" rather than ""hate speech."""

1. The tweet's content discusses a historical perspective on political tactics and their impact on certain groups, specifically referencing post-Civil War Reconstruction and the New Deal era.
2. It does not contain any overtly hate-filled language or direct attacks on any group. Instead, it presents an opinionated view of historical events and political strategies.
3. The tweet's objective seems to be discussing a political tactic (""let's all get along"") and its historical usage, rather than promoting hostility or division.

While the text touches upon sensitive topics like race relations and political tactics, it does so in a way that aims to present an analysis of historical events. It doesn't employ language designed to incite hatred or promote harm against any group. Therefore, despite discussing potentially controversial subjects, the tweet's educational tone and lack of explicit bigotry categorizes it as 'neutral'.",22.05,"[ 1.4510182   0.11451794  2.5632396  ...  5.5767713   3.5197163

The use of the term ""nigger"" in association with an entire genre of music characterizes it as ""garbage,"" making this statement both hate speech and deeply racist.

Key features:
- The word 'nigger' is a notorious racial slur that has historically been used to demean and dehumanize black people.
- Associating this term with rap, a genre deeply rooted in African American culture, serves to denigrate the entire community associated with it.

The target of this hate speech is clearly the African American community. The tweet uses one of the most provocative slurs in an attempt to diminish both the people and their cultural contributions.

The context and tone of the statement are blatantly hostile. There is no ambiguity in the intent to offend, demean, and spread animosity towards the targeted group.

The text contains a highly derogatory term that targets both African and female groups. The key feature here is the phrase ""nigger variant,"" which explicitly compares women to a racial slur. This comparison perpetuates an attitude of supremacy and denigration, indicating that the user intends to offend or demean these targeted groups.

The context suggests the author's growing belief in this derogatory association, further emphasizing the offense. The tone is casual yet degrading, suggesting a lack of respect for those being discussed. Despite the informal tone, the statement clearly demeans and insults both African individuals and women, aligning it with an offensive classification.

This classification is supported by several factors:
- The request for a picture with Obama suggests curiosity rather than hostility or offense. 
- While mentioning bombing Muslim countries is sensitive, the phrasing questions whether courtney asked Obama about it, not endorsing the actions themselves.
- No overtly inflammatory language is used against any group.

The neutral tone and focus on seeking information about a past interaction contribute to its normal classification. The text references political events but does so in a detached manner without promoting hate or offense towards any target group.

The tweet's context involves the user's experience at a motel, where they found the presence of African hair in towels repulsive. This personal anecdote is then linked to a hope that President Trump will replace towels at the White House, implying a desire for exclusion or erasure of African presence and influence.

Considering the historical weight and inflammatory nature of the term used, along with the tweet's denigrating tone towards African individuals, it clearly falls into the hate speech category.

However, considering the context—discussing music preferences and knowledge—it seems more like an observational critique than an attack on identity. The user's intent appears to be discussing musical diversity and fandom behavior rather than disparaging a group based on race or sexuality.

In conclusion, while the tweet contains some generalization about a specific demographic, it doesn't cross the line into hate speech or direct offensiveness. It remains within the bounds of opinionated discussion about music appreciation and knowledge, thus justifying its classification as normal.",19.85,"[-0.24220608  0.08420458 -0.17222078 ...  7.742045   -4.0159965

However, upon closer analysis, there are some elements that could potentially be deemed as offensive or indicative of hate speech.

Firstly, the term ""pakis"" is a colloquial and sometimes derogatory term used to refer to individuals of Pakistani descent. Its use in this context could be perceived as negative or stereotyping, particularly when associated with a claim about police hatred towards this group. This aspect pushes the text towards an offensive classification.

Moreover, the reference to ""white children"" potentially being targeted by this alleged hate also introduces an element of racial tension into the discussion. 

However, despite these features, the overall message is not explicitly promoting violence or direct harm towards any group. Instead, it appears to be expressing a viewpoint or personal belief about perceived societal issues.

The context and tone are crucial here; they indicate a complaint or grievance rather than an incitement of hatred. The user seems to be critiquing what they perceive as unfair treatment by the police towards Pakistani individuals and by extension, white children seen with them.

Therefore, while there are elements in this text that could be considered problematic, it doesn't cross the threshold into hate speech. It remains within the realm of normal discourse, albeit on a sensitive topic and employing language that could offend some readers.

Upon close examination, the tweet appears to be a heated exchange between users, involving strong language and historical references. However, it lacks direct hate speech or explicitly targeted offense.

- The key points revolve around historical claims and personal attacks but do not cross into clear-cut hate speech.
- Though the tone is aggressive and some historical references might be inflammatory, they don't amount to a direct call for violence or vilification of a group. 
- No specific derogatory terms are used towards an identifiable group.

Furthermore, the tweet suggests that the attack resulting in deaths is justified retaliation for past actions.

The tweet text ""lol what a stupid kike"" uses the term ""kike,"" which is an ethnic slur used to target Jewish people. This word choice and the negative sentiment expressed through calling someone ""stupid"" solidify its classification as hate speech.

- The tweet's mocking tone further amplifies the harm and offensiveness of the language used.

Target Group Impact:
- This language targets Jewish individuals, perpetuating negative stereotypes and fostering an environment of hostility and intolerance.

Key features include the words ""curry,"" a derogatory term for individuals of Indian descent; ""nigger,"" an egregious slur against African people; and ""kikess,"" an anti-Semitic term for Jewish people or those perceived as supporting Israeli policies. These terms are coupled with references to Israel, further highlighting the text's bigotry towards multiple groups.

The usage of such inflammatory language in describing these communities categorizes this as hate speech. The author employs a mocking tone, further indicating intent to demean and offend the targeted groups.

However, it does touch upon sensitive topics like immigration and legal status.

Key points:
1. The mention of fining (likely meant as 'finding') people for calling someone an ""illegal alien"" suggests a discussion on the consequences of using such terminology.
2. The phrase ""at my willing to do good evil is present"" implies that even with good intentions, negative outcomes can emerge.

The text does not directly engage in hate speech or overt offensiveness but raises concerns about the potential for harm in enforcing certain language norms. It cautions against unintended consequences, even from seemingly positive actions.

In conclusion, while the tweet discusses a sensitive issue and acknowledges the potential for negativity, it avoids explicit hate or offense, leading to its classification as neutral.",21.01,[ 0.6506705  3.9421022 -0.6976283 ...  8.933379  -1.7227173  1.1487886],1, normal

This word has historically been used to denigrate African-Americans and perpetuate racism. The phrase ""move along go be a nigger somewhere else"" further emphasizes the speaker's intent to offend and marginalize the target group, reinforcing the classification as hate speech. The inclusion of this slur, combined with the dismissive tone, makes it clear that the statement is meant to demean and exclude based on race, aligning with the definition of hate speech.",11.33,[ 4.424855   2.9668667 -0.7185595 ...  7.9290094 -4.2237115  7.6840596],0," hate speech.

The user seems to be jokingly referring to a group of people defending something, possibly a pet called 'pibble', in an exaggerated manner.

Key points that support this classification:
- The usage of informal language like ""lol"", ""be like"", and ""dindu nuffin"" indicates a light-hearted, conversational tone.
- The phrase ""defense brigade"" is used humorously to describe an overzealous group of supporters.
- There are no signs of targeted hate or explicit offensiveness in the text.

The tweet's intent appears to be humorous commentary rather than aggressive targeting. While it mentions defending something and a disagreement about statistics, these elements don't cross into hate speech or severe offensiveness.

The tweet criticizes Muslim countries for not accepting refugees and suggests that the host countries are being forced to adapt to the refugees' way of life, characterizing them as ""parasites"". 

However, the tweet lacks explicitly hate speech or direct personal attacks. It discusses a political topic — the refugee crisis — which is subject to debate. Although it employs strong language and could be interpreted as insensitive or critical towards Muslim countries and refugees, it does not contain clear slurs or calls for violence that would categorize it as hate speech.

The key features influencing this classification include the absence of direct personal attacks, overtly hostile language, or explicit incitement. The tweet comments on a political issue without crossing into outright bigotry.

In conclusion, despite its critical tone and strong language regarding a sensitive political topic, this text is classified as ""normal"" because it stops short of hate speech or direct offensiveness. It uses provocative but not explicitly abusive language to express an opinion on the refugee crisis, which remains a debated issue in global politics.",23.63,"[ 1.4782106   1.3830929  -0.7413106  ... -2.0124502   0.88900423

However, upon a closer examination, there are elements within the tweet that might be considered sensitive or potentially inflammatory.

- The tweet makes reference to Trump and his immigration policies, which have historically been a contentious topic. 
- It suggests that two users should not let ""trump know he will cage them for being illegal aliens."" This implies that the speaker is referring to the recipients as 'illegal aliens' who would be subject to detention under Trump's policies.
- The tone of the message appears to be tongue-in-cheek, which might mitigate some of its negative connotations. Yet, it also carries an undertone of xenophobia and fearmongering by referencing caging of human beings.
- While there is no direct hate speech or overtly aggressive language, the tweet does reference a sensitive political issue in a somewhat mocking manner.

However, considering the lack of specific targets and the absence of clear incitement to violence or hatred, the classification of this text as neutral may still be justifiable.

The text does not promote or encourage hatred, nor does it contain any slurs or explicit language that would be considered hate speech or even just plainly offensive. 

The key features that support this classification are:

- The fictional nature of the claims: The statements about Aragorn, Arwen, Sherlock Holmes, and Mrs. Carmichael are not factual but rather imaginative interpretations or jokes related to these characters.

- Lack of targeting towards any real group: While Hitler and Eva Braun are historical figures, the claim made about them is so absurd and disconnected from reality that it does not target or offend Jewish people or Holocaust survivors in a serious manner.

The key features supporting this classification include:

1. **Derogatory language**: Use of the term ""nigger"" which is a well-known slur against African individuals.
2. **Dehumanizing tone**: The phrase implies a dismissal of any action or behavior as substandard merely based on race.

The tweet's impact on the target group is significant, as it perpetuates historical patterns of oppression and marginalization through its language. The context and tone convey an intent to demean and offend, leaving no ambiguity about the user's malicious purpose.

Although not directly targeting a specific group, the flippant use of such a serious topic can be seen as highly insensitive and potentially triggering for survivors of sexual violence. The tone appears to downplay the severity of sexual assault by suggesting it as an acceptable outcome in a disagreement.

However, despite its disturbing content, without clear context about who ""them"" refers to or what situation is being discussed, labeling this as hate speech would be speculative. Its offhand treatment of a grave issue tilts towards classifying it as offensive rather than normal speech.

In conclusion, the tweet's casual reference to rape in an argumentative context veers into highly problematic territory that some may consider crossing the line into offense or even hate speech due to its trivialization of sexual violence.

   - Labeling Lee Hsien Loong, a prominent political figure of Chinese ethnicity, as ""satanist"" incites extreme animosity and vilification based on both race and religion. 
   
2. **Target**: The tweet specifically targets an individual of Asian descent (Lee Hsien Loong) and by extension, the broader Asian community through its use of a racial slur.

3. **Tone/Intent**: The aggressive tone and intent to provoke outrage against the targeted individual and group are evident, further solidifying the hate speech classification.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The combination of a direct attack on an individual using deeply offensive language and the clear intent to incite hatred towards Asians qualifies this tweet as unambiguous hate speech.",25.94,[ 5.0133214  3.815621  -1.0918562 ...  8.659996  -3.1969156 -2.1600513],0, hate speech

Explanation: The text contains several derogatory terms towards different ethnic groups, including ""spic,"" ""latino,"" ""Italians,"" and ""heebs.""

Key points supporting this classification:

1. The tweet discusses murder rates in different areas without promoting violence.
2. It acknowledges the existence of racists but does not endorse their views or target any group with hate.

The context appears to be a discussion on regional crime statistics and social issues, rather than an intent to incite hatred or offense against specific groups.

The text contains strong language directed at an individual user. However, based on the limited context provided, it appears to be an interpersonal conflict rather than systematic hate speech or targeted offense towards a specific group.

Key features:
- The use of profanity and intense dislike expressed (""i fucking hate you"") suggests a heated personal disagreement.
- The heart emoji at the end may indicate this is more of an exaggerated expression of frustration within a relationship, rather than genuine hate.

Impact on target: 
- The tweet directly addresses another user with hostile language. However, without additional context about their relationship or reason for conflict, it's difficult to assess the full impact.

Context and tone:
- The use of casual internet slang (""fucking"") and an emoji point more towards an emotionally charged personal dispute than organized hate speech.
- While the sentiment is certainly negative, it lacks the ideological motivations that typically characterize hate speech.

Conclusion: 
Based on the provided information, this appears to be a normal expression of personal animosity in the context of social media interactions, rather than systematic hate speech or targeted group offense. However, more context would be needed to fully understand the nature and severity of the conflict. The language is intense but seems directed at an individual over a specific grievance, keeping it within the realm of ""normal"" discourse for this medium.",31.6,[ 2.7120922  0.3639835 -0.8404337 ... 12.977054   0.7259111  1.5790473],1," hate speech. The user's statement is a clear expression of hatred, and the use of the heart symbol does not change the intent or meaning of the message. This aligns more closely with the definition of hate speech, which involves language that denigrates or expresses hatred towards a target group or individual. Additionally, the repetition of ""i hate you"" reinforces this sentiment, making it even more important to classify this statement as hate speech. The context provided in the examples further supports this decision by demonstrating how similar statements have been classified as hate speech due to their explicit language and clear expression of hatred towards another individual."

It aims not just to attack Griffin's political views but also her gender and presumed sexual orientation. The user employs these slurs with clear intent to offend and harm, exacerbating the severity beyond mere offensiveness.

However, the text does use informal and somewhat suggestive language (""happy to say you all been statutory raped"") which could be seen as problematic by some users. The inclusion of an emoji (😂) at the end might suggest that the user is making a joke or not being entirely serious.

The tweet contains the term ""wigger,"" which is a slang and pejorative term used to refer to Caucasian individuals who emulate the perceived cultural traits of African Americans. The use of this term, especially in the context of insult (""butthurt""), indicates that it is meant to demean and denigrate.

This classification into hate speech is justified by:
- The presence of a racially charged slang term targeting Caucasians.
- The aggressive tone, with the word ""wigger"" being used as an insult, revealing the user's intent to offend or provoke.
- The target group (Caucasian) is explicitly identified and negatively referenced.

Explanation: The term ""butthurt"" is used to insult someone who is perceived as overreacting or sensitive, while the use of ""wigger"" can be seen as a derogatory term towards people of African descent. This language can be considered offensive and disrespectful, particularly when directed at individuals based on their race or ethnicity.

However, it's important to note that context is key in determining the severity of such language. In this specific case, without further information about the context of the interaction between the users, it's difficult to determine if this text constitutes hate speech. It can be seen as a less severe form of offensive language that falls short of hate speech, but still warrants caution and consideration of its impact on individuals.

Regarding the examples given in the context, they help provide some guidance on how to approach similar situations by considering factors such as intent, tone, and specific targets of the language used. However, it's important to remember that every situation is unique and should be evaluated based on its own context."

2. **Impact on Target Group**: The statement directly targets heterosexual people, suggesting they should undergo a medical procedure to understand the queer experience. This promotes violence and intolerance towards a specific group based on sexual orientation.

3. **Tone and Intent**: The tone is aggressive, advocating for a severe and irreversible medical intervention against a group simply for their sexual orientation. The intent appears to be provocative, aiming to offend or incite rather than engage in meaningful dialogue.

4. **Classification Justification**: While the tweet uses shocking language to make a point about empathy and understanding (implying heterosexual individuals could never truly understand the queer experience without being forcibly altered), its method of expression is deeply problematic and inflammatory. It crosses into offensiveness by suggesting violence as a means to an end, utilizing a term for a medical procedure with a history of abuse (""lobotomizing"") to make its point.

In conclusion, the tweet is classified as ""offensive"" due to its advocacy for violent action against a specific demographic group based on sexual orientation, utilizing provocative and inflammatory language that targets and marginalizes heterosexual individuals.",36.61,[-3.1859992  4.893638  -2.0897608 ... 12.337882  -5.797253   2.9874837],2, offensive

The key features ""crackers"" and ""kike"" are both derogatory terms, with ""crackers"" referring to white people in a pejorative sense and ""kike"" being an extremely vulgar slur against Jewish individuals.

The tweet's structure, recommending against watching certain movies while derisively labeling them as ""propaganda,"" reveals an intent to spread animosity towards the targeted group. The tone is overtly hostile and exclusionary.

While the movies listed span different genres and themes, the common thread appears to be their positive portrayals of minority groups, which the user seems to object to in a very aggressive manner. This context further supports the classification as it suggests an underlying prejudice motivating the post.

In conclusion, the tweet's usage of explicit slurs, hostile tone, and targeting of a religious group based on propagandistic motives justifies its labeling as highly offensive content intended to demean and attack Jewish people.",20.8,"[ 0.35115725  3.966426   -2.603765   ...  9.568549   -2.2207525

1. Although it mentions sensitive groups like Nazis and white nationalists, it does not directly promote or endorse their ideologies.
2. The phrase ""if you polled nazis and white nationalists"" is used in a sarcastic manner rather than supporting these groups' views.
3. It criticizes Breitbart readers by equating them to these extreme groups, but this criticism itself doesn't make the text hate speech.

Key features that justify the normal label include:
- Sarcastic tone: The use of ""lol"" and the hypothetical polling scenario indicate sarcasm rather than serious endorsement.
- Criticism without promotion: While it negatively references extreme groups, it does so in a critical manner.

- Claims of genetic inferiority and animality directed at an entire race.
- The assertion that this group will always remain second-rate due to inherent characteristics.

The text explicitly targets African individuals, employing dehumanizing language to perpetuate false biological and cultural hierarchies. 

The tone is aggressive and intolerant, revealing a clear intent to demean and marginalize based on race. There is no context in which such vitriolic bigotry could be seen as acceptable or justified.

Although it describes strong negative emotions towards a certain group (white people), the key features are not overtly inflammatory or aggressive terms commonly associated with hate speech.

However, one might argue that the context implies prejudice against white individuals by stating ""<user> hates that he is part white so bad he can not not stand white people."" The ""deep seething hatred"" and the suggestion of an ""agenda against blacks"" could potentially be seen as promoting a hostile view towards white individuals. 

Despite these elements, the text itself does not employ clear slurs or promote violence or direct harm, which distinguishes it from outright hate speech. It presents a description of personal feelings rather than inciting animosity or aggression.

The lack of identifiable key features that are explicitly associated with hate speech reinforces this classification. The tone and language used do not match the intensity typically seen in texts classified as hate speech or even offensive.

Explanation: The text shows clear evidence of harboring intense hatred towards white people, making it a hateful expression. It is important to note that expressing negative sentiments or emotions towards an individual or group does not necessarily constitute hate speech. However, in this case, the user's remarks contain repeated derogatory statements about white people and a demonstrable bias against them. This text promotes prejudice and animosity, which are key characteristics of hate speech.

Additionally, it is important to remember that hate speech can target various aspects such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. In this instance, the user's expressions directly pertain to racial bias. The user's statements suggest a deep-seated hatred and an unwillingness to accept his own part-white identity. This attitude fosters an environment of intolerance and negativity towards white people as a whole, which is inappropriate and harmful.

Therefore, based on the context, tone, and clear display of hatred towards a specific demographic group (whites), this text should be classified as hate speech."

By employing such language, the user perpetuates negative stereotypes and creates a hostile atmosphere that can marginalize or offend members of these communities.

The tone is dismissive and mocking, further emphasizing the intent to belittle and degrade rather than engage in meaningful discussion. This dismissive attitude towards the target group reinforces the offensiveness of the text.

3. The specific mention of ""grand kids"" in relation to both African and Jewish people with a mix of races, shows an attempt to denigrate these communities by bringing their families into the attack.

4. The context includes a comparison with President Trump, using the term ""jew"" in a negative light, suggesting a broader condemnation based on religious identity as well.

- The phrasing is ambiguous and lacks explicit hate speech or direct offense.
- No overtly derogatory terms are used; it lists diverse groups neutrally.
- Without more context, the intent behind the question remains unclear.

While this could potentially be classified as offensive due to its grouping of various demographics in a seemingly negative query, given the absence of clear evidence of malicious intent or specific inflammatory language, I'll classify it as normal with caution. 

To confidently label it as hate speech or even just offensive, additional context would be needed to determine if the question is based on stereotypes/prejudices or if it's posed genuinely seeking understanding.

- The tweet text: ""<user> sorry he a slut"" uses the term ""slut,"" which is a derogatory and misogynistic slur used to shame women for their sexuality or sexual behavior.

- Target: While no specific individual or group is mentioned, the term generalizes about women, implying promiscuity in a negative context.
- The casual use of such a loaded term suggests intent to demean without consideration for its impact, reinforcing toxic attitudes towards women's sexuality.

Explanation:
- tweet_text: ""<user> um yea all they dykes to me 😂 including me ╚╝ ✊ ♀️""
- The text contains the term ""dyke,"" which is considered derogatory towards lesbians when used as a slur. However, in this context, it appears that the user is using the term self-referentially and humorously, similar to the examples provided.
- The use of laughing emojis further suggests a lighthearted tone, but the inclusion of ""including me"" could potentially be seen as targeting others in the LGBTQ+ community, which could be perceived as offensive, even if unintended.
- The decision to classify this text as offensive is based on the potential for harm or offense, as the use of a historically derogatory term, even in a self-referential and seemingly lighthearted context, could still cause unintentional harm to individuals who have been targeted by that slur in the past.
- However, it's important to note that the interpretation of this text's intent can be subjective, and some may argue that it is normal or even celebratory in nature given the user's self-identification as a dyke and use of the term humorously. Ultimately, the decision to classify this text as offensive is based on the potential for harm or offense, rather than any definitive malicious intent."

Given the lack of explicit endorsement or promotion of violence and the apparent aim to call out reprehensible statements, the text leans towards normal. Yet, it's essential to consider the context surrounding this post for a more conclusive assessment. In isolation, while distasteful in its content, it doesn't seem to incite hatred or directly offend any group.

Summary:
- The tweet expresses the user's frustration about having to go to work in cold weather.
- No key features indicate hate speech or offense; it lacks controversial content or targeted language.

Analysis:
- The tweet does not contain any slurs, demeaning remarks, or sensitive topics that would categorize it as hate speech or even offensive. 
- It employs casual, informal language like ""af"" (as fuck) and ""bitch,"" but this is used to emphasize the user's dissatisfaction with their situation rather than to insult a specific group.
- The tweet does not target any particular individual or demographic.

The sentence structure suggests that an individual (referred to as ""the white dude"") has directed this slur at another person.

- Accusation of supporting xenophobia despite having immigrant parents.
- Mention of threatening international alliances.

The criticism is directed at the individual's perceived hypocrisy rather than their race or ethnicity.

Conclusion:

However, it lacks clear indicators of hate speech such as targeting specific groups based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc.

The phrase ""fuk all yall hoes"" uses a derogatory term for women which is highly offensive. Calling people ""muthafuka"" also expresses strong hostility. 

However, without more context it's hard to determine if this is general profanity not directed at anyone specifically vs. an attack on a particular individual or group. The references to ""biggie smalls intro words to juicy"" seem like potential song lyrics which could be quoting the language rather than endorsing it.

Overall, while very crude and vulgar language is used here, in isolation without clear targeting of protected groups this doesn't quite rise to the level of hate speech. It's more of a strongly worded rant with extremely profane language that would likely be considered highly offensive by most people. But additional context would be needed to confidently classify it as hate speech.

So in summary:
- Extremely vulgar and hostile language used
- No clear targeting of protected classes based on the text alone 
- Likely intended as an aggressive insult rather than promoting hate against a group
- Hard to be fully certain without more surrounding context

1. **Label Implication**: The classification of hate speech indicates that the content promotes or encourages animosity towards a specific group.

2. **Key Features Support**: The key features, particularly the term ""mudslimes,"" which appears to be a combination of ""muds"" and ""Muslims,"" is a clear example of a slur used against followers of Islam. This fabricated word aims to degrade and insult this religious group, indicating hate speech.

3. **Target Group Impact**: The text explicitly targets Muslims by using the slur ""mudslimes."" It also suggests that they were in control of ""our country"" for the last ""<number>"" years, which could foster a sense of grievance or resentment among readers against this group.

4. **Context and Tone Analysis**: The context of referring to a change from the leadership of a specific religious group (""mudslimes"") as ""a big fresh change"" implies that their previous influence was negative. This is reinforced by the use of a pejorative term, suggesting the user's intent to demean and express hostility towards this group.

5. **Conclusion**: The combination of the fabricated slur targeting Muslims and the implied negativity associated with their leadership in the country justifies the classification of hate speech. This text aims to provoke animosity against an identifiable religious group, reinforcing its categorization as hate speech.",28.51,[ 5.1385827  0.8629103 -4.90175   ...  5.8362956 -1.7151866  2.7987747],0, hate speech

Key features:
- The mention of ""nazi"" and ""white supremacist"" suggests potential hate speech, but in this context, they're part of a question rather than a statement endorsing these beliefs.

Target:
- The tweet refers to an ""old lady,"" but without additional information, we can't determine if it's targeting a specific individual or group.

Considering the context and tone, the user seems to be seeking clarification on someone's actions rather than promoting hate. Despite the sensitive terms used, this alone doesn't qualify as hate speech since no ideology is endorsed or propagated.

Conclusion:
- The text lacks clear evidence of promoting or endorsing hate ideologies.
- The inquiry format and absence of a specific target make it difficult to categorize as hate speech or even offensive content.
- It's classified as normal due to the lack of explicit endorsement of hate ideologies, despite mentioning sensitive terms in a questioning context.",23.81,"[ 1.380189    0.23816712 -0.43822926 ...  5.630502   -1.2805372

Here's a concise analysis:

1. The label 'Normal' suggests that while the language used might be colloquial or even slightly aggressive, it does not cross the line into hate speech or direct offensiveness.

2. Key features: The term ""bitch"" is typically seen as inflammatory; however, in this context, it appears to be used more in a self-referential manner or as part of slang, rather than targeting someone maliciously.

3. Target: There is no clear target of hate or offense in the text. The user seems to be engaging in self-description using slang terms.

4. Context and tone: Without additional context, the tone appears to be assertive but not necessarily hostile or aggressive towards others. It's crucial to consider the cultural and subcultural contexts where such language might be commonplace.

5. Conclusion: Based on these factors, the tweet is classified as 'Normal'. While it uses strong language, there's no discernible intent to harm or promote animosity against a specific group or individual.

The text also includes references to controlling powers within Germany and the United States. This conspiracy theory is a common trope in hate speech that falsely accuses Jews of secretly controlling world events.

Furthermore, the use of the term ""enablers"" implies that there are non-Jewish individuals who are complicit in this alleged control. The mention of well-known figures like Bill Gates adds an additional layer of conspiracy and misinformation to the text.

The overall tone is aggressive and accusatory, with a clear intent to spread animosity towards the targeted groups. It contributes to an environment of hostility and discrimination against Asian, Caucasian, and Jewish individuals.

- The tweet text includes a highly offensive term, ""nigger,"" which is an egregious racial slur. This term is used in conjunction with another negative descriptor, ""skunks."" 
- The key features that support this classification are the use of ""nigger"" and ""skunks"". These words are meant to degrade and demean, evoking historical and contemporary prejudices against African people.
- The target group is clearly identified as ""African,"" confirming that the intent is to malign an entire race based on their ethnicity. 
- Given the context and tone, it's evident that this tweet is intended to incite hatred or contempt against African individuals by comparing them to animals seen as pests in a negative light.

1. The label implies that the content could be perceived as insulting or demeaning to a specific group.
2. Key features such as 'trailer trash', 'messy bun', 'padded bra', and 'meth body' contribute to an unflattering portrayal of women, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. These phrases stereotype and disparage individuals based on their appearance and supposed lifestyle choices.
3. The target group is Caucasian women, specifically those who may be struggling with addiction or poverty. This demographic is reduced to negative stereotypes about their appearance and habits.
4. The tone is judgmental and pejorative, displaying a lack of empathy or understanding for the challenges these individuals might face.

Key points supporting this classification:

1. No direct hate speech or explicit offensiveness: The language used doesn't employ overtly derogatory terms targeting any group.
2. Critique of selective activism: The tweet seems to criticize a political party (Labour) for being selectively anti-racist, implying hypocrisy in their stance.

The tweet's controversial elements center around accusing an entity (the Labour party) of ignoring sexual exploitation tied to race. However, the wording lacks direct abusive language or clear incitement of hatred against any group. The tone is more accusatory and critical than overtly hostile or bigoted.

In conclusion, while touching on sensitive social issues, the tweet's intent appears to be political criticism rather than promoting hate or offensiveness towards any demographic.

- Mentioning ""police state"" and ""white supremacy system"" does carry a negative connotation, but it's presented as part of a larger critique.
- There are no obvious slurs or dehumanizing language directed at any ethnic or social group.

Given these factors, the text seems to be an attempt at serious commentary on societal issues.

Key phrases include ""wtf is wrong with these demon rats"" which uses dehumanizing language (demon rats) targeting a group based on their immigration status, and ""do not let the medical records for illegal aliens fast track"". This indicates a stance against prioritizing healthcare for this group over veterans.

While the tone is frustrated and disapproving of current policies, it stops short of outright hate speech or severe offensiveness. The tweet argues a political position that undocumented immigrants should not receive priority for government services over veterans, a view some may find objectionable but which falls within the realm of normal political discourse.

In summary, the strong language and negative characterization of an ethnic group based on legal status pushes this close to being classified as offensive. However, the core message relates to policy priorities for different groups rather than attacking qualities intrinsic to undocumented immigrants themselves. Considering this, a classification of ""normal"" is most appropriate - it expresses an opinion held by some on an emotionally charged political topic, but does so without extremely inflammatory or dehumanizing language that would merit stronger labeling.

   - The term ""shitskins"" is used in a derogatory manner to target individuals of Asian and Indian descent.
   - The phrase ""fast-talking jew tool"" negatively stereotypes Jewish people based on ethnic stereotypes, further perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes.
   
3. Impact on the target group: 
   - This text employs language that demeans and attacks multiple groups (Asian, Indian, Jewish) by using slurs and promoting negative stereotypes about these communities.

4. Context and tone:
   - The context implies opposition to free speech and diversity (""anti free speech"", ""does not care if america goes brown"").

- The tweet contains multiple derogatory terms targeting race and appearance, specifically referring to an African individual as ""nigger"" and making crude remarks about their body. This language is overtly hostile and degrading.

- Key features such as ""fat"", ""tits"", and ""pubes"" in conjunction with the target's race emphasize the bigotry and malice behind the statement. The usage of ""hayid"" (an apparent slang or misspelled term) further contributes to the demeaning nature of the comment.

This term is highly inflammatory and dehumanizing, targeting adherents of Islam.

Key Features:
- The usage of ""every muzrat country,"" broadens the scope of the offense to include all countries with Muslim populations.
- By labeling various political entities as regimes while calling Trump's presidency a ""legally elected govt,"" it attempts to delegitimize other governments and promote an us-vs-them mentality.

Impact on Target:
- The term ""muzrat"" is intended to vilify Muslims, creating a hostile environment that encourages prejudice against them.
- By grouping various countries together based on their Muslim populations, it fosters animosity towards these nations and their people.

Context and Tone:
- The tone is highly charged and combative, indicating strong anti-Muslim sentiment.
- It attempts to frame the discussion in a manner that legitimizes one political leadership (Trump's) while dismissing others, using religion as the basis for differentiation.

Conclusion:
The classification of ""Offensive"" is justified due to its use of dehumanizing language aimed at Muslims and the broad generalization used to vilify countries with Muslim populations. The tweet's tone and intent are clearly hostile towards Islam and its adherents, crossing the line from political commentary into outright bigotry.",35.3,[-1.2084796 -0.7133907 -0.5197742 ... -1.5200074 -5.5968876  5.9619455],2," offensive.

This word has historically been used to demean and oppress African-Americans, making its usage in this context a clear indication of racial animosity.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- The repeated use of ""nigger"", which is an extremely offensive ethnic slur.
- The lack of any contextual information that could justify or mitigate the term's offensiveness.

The tweet seems to make light of the slur, suggesting its rhyming potential is a positive because it allows rapper Lil Wayne to maintain his career. This not only trivializes the harm caused by such language but also perpetuates negative stereotypes about African-Americans and their contributions to music and culture.

The intended target of this text appears to be African-Americans, as evidenced by the repeated use of ""nigger"". The tone is demeaning and dismissive, showing a clear intent to offend and belittle based on race.

The words chosen carry strong negative connotations, implying moral depravity and intellectual inferiority of the targeted group. Furthermore, the allegation of drugging and manipulation of family members introduces an additional layer of hostility and accusation.

The tone is aggressive and accusatory, with a clear intent to demean and insult the target group. The reference to the speaker's own family adds a personal dimension that intensifies the offense.

The language is aggressive and inflammatory, displaying prejudice and hostility towards the targeted group. By asserting that homosexuals only want children for nefarious reasons, it contributes to a narrative of suspicion and mistrust.

- The phrase ""karma is a bitch"" conveys the idea of retribution but doesn't target anyone specifically.
- It lacks controversial content or direct offense to any individual or collective identity.

Secondly, the tone is more observational than hostile or aggressive. It's noting changes in what's considered acceptable humor rather than expressing animosity towards any community.

Thirdly, while it mentions Asian and homosexual groups, it does so in the context of comedy trends rather than targeting them with hate or offense. The use of ""that all we have got"" suggests a lament about limited comedic options without vilifying the mentioned groups.

Explanation: The text implies a restriction on certain types of humor, specifically referencing the use of derogatory terms for LGBTQ+ individuals and Asian people.

This mindset can contribute to the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes and offensive language.

1. The label's implication: The classification of 'normal' suggests that the content does not contain hate speech or overtly offensive language.

2. Key features supporting this classification: The tweet lacks any explicit or coded language that is commonly associated with hate speech or offensiveness. While it mentions ""white tears,"" which could potentially be considered racially charged, the context doesn't provide clear evidence to support this interpretation.

3. Impact on or reference to the target group: Although Caucasians are mentioned, the phrase ""white tears"" alone isn't sufficiently hostile or demeaning in this context to categorize it as hate speech or even offensive.

4. Context and tone assessment: Without additional context, it's difficult to gauge the user's full intent behind the statement. However, the overall tone doesn't appear to be aggressive or malicious.

5. Justification for classification: Given the lack of clearly identifiable hate speech or overt offensiveness, along with an ambiguous phrase that could be interpreted in different ways based on the missing context, the most appropriate classification is 'normal'.

1. Criticism of individuals using the slur: The author uses strong language to condemn people who resort to using the term 'nigger'. This indicates disapproval rather than endorsement.

2. Emphasis on intelligence and vocabulary: The author implies that those who use such slurs lack an extensive vocabulary or wit, suggesting a critique of intellectual capacity or maturity in communication.

The target group, although not explicitly stated, seems to be individuals who resort to using the term 'nigger'. However, the text doesn't foster hatred or prejudice against this group but rather criticizes their choice of language. The user's intent appears to be highlighting the inadequacy and offensiveness of such a slur in adult conversation.

Explanation:
- The user input contains multiple offensive terms: ""yid,"" ""pig,"" ""snyde rat,"" and ""fucking.""
- ""Yid"" is a derogatory term for Jewish individuals, which has historically been used to demean, intimidate, and marginalize them. Its use perpetuates negative stereotypes and can contribute to an environment of prejudice and hostility.
- The term ""pig"" is often used as an insult towards someone who is considered unclean or despicable. In this context, it can be perceived as dehumanizing the target and further demonstrating a lack of respect or consideration for their worth as a human being.
- The phrase ""snyde rat"" can be interpreted as another derogatory term, implying that the individual is deceitful and deserving of contempt.
- The user's statement includes a wish for legal action against the person they are targeting, including financial ruin and imprisonment. This not only perpetuates hostility but also promotes violence, which further escalates the situation and creates an environment that can be harmful to both parties involved.

Given the presence of multiple offensive terms and the clear intention to harm and intimidate another person, this user input is classified as hate speech."

Key features supporting this classification include:
- The term ""filthy kike"" which is an overtly anti-Semitic slur used to demean Jews.
- The phrase ""money grubbing"", often associated with negative stereotypes about Jewish people and money, amplifying the bigotry.
- ""Shekels"", a reference to Israeli currency, further highlights the targeting of the Jewish identity.

The text's impact on the targeted group is highly detrimental, promoting hatred and reinforcing prejudiced tropes. The tone is aggressive and hostile, indicating clear intent to offend and incite animosity towards Jews.

In conclusion, the classification of hate speech is justified by the use of explicit anti-Semitic slurs, references to stereotypes, targeting based on ethnicity and religion, and a belligerent tone aiming to provoke malice against the Jewish community.

1. The word ""hoes"" is a crucial feature in this classification, as it is a derogatory term used to degrade and disrespect women.

2. The tweet directly targets women through its language, creating a negative and hostile environment for the group.

3. The context appears to be sexual or related to transactional sex, which further contributes to the offense. This is inferred from the phrase ""chasing a sack,"" commonly understood as pursuing money, possibly in exchange for sexual activities. 

4. The user's intent seems to demean women involved in such activities without any regard for their welfare or dignity.

Describing this group as ""inbred retards"" with low IQs adds an ableist insult and promotes a false genetic inferiority, compounding the offensiveness.

The context suggests a broad, prejudiced generalization about Muslims, without any specific incident or behavior to justify such characterization. The tone is blatantly derisive and dehumanizing, clearly intended to provoke and demean.

Key factors influencing this assessment:
1. The shorthand ""vs"" (versus) suggests opposition or competition.
2. ""Moslem"" is a dated and sometimes considered derogatory spelling variant of ""Muslim"".
3. There's no additional context to definitively categorize the intent behind this tweet.

Explanation: The text contains multiple slurs targeting different communities (lesbians, LGBTQ+ individuals, and Jews). While the context is not provided in this example, using such language can be considered hate speech or offensive, potentially causing harm to those groups.

However, it's essential to remember that context plays a significant role in understanding the intended meaning and impact of language.

This further cements the classification as it propagates a prejudiced stereotype against the targeted group.

Additionally, while discussing Islam and potential violence from its followers, the text uses the term ""moslems,"" which is an intentional misspelling aimed at mocking and undermining the religious group.

Key features such as ""kike,"" a derogatory term for Jews, and ""pedo,"" implying pedophilia, are highly inflammatory and damaging. These terms are used to promote hatred and perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jews.

The phrase ""moralfaggotry"" adds another layer of offense by suggesting that the targeted individual or group holds immoral values, further stigmatizing them based on their identity.

1. The text falls into the hate speech category due to its use of highly derogatory and abusive language targeted at a homosexual woman.

2. Key features that support this classification include slurs like 'dyke', 'cunt', and 'bully'. These terms are used in a hostile manner, reinforcing negative stereotypes about homosexuality and women.

3. The target group is clearly identified as both homosexual individuals and women. The language used demeans and dehumanizes the individual being referred to, which is a common trait in hate speech.

4. The context suggests an intent to demean and assert dominance over the targeted woman. The tone is aggressive and threatening, with phrases like ""put back in place"" implying a need for control or punishment.

5. In conclusion, the text's classification as hate speech is justified by its use of extreme slurs, targeting based on sexual orientation and gender, and the aggressive tone that seeks to demean and intimidate.

Explanation: The given text contains multiple instances of derogatory language targeting individuals based on their perceived sexual orientation, physical appearance, and gender. By referring to someone as a ""confused dyke bully cunt"" and implying that they do not have a penis, the user is utilizing hate speech to demean and belittle the targeted person. The use of terms like ""bully,"" ""cunt,"" and ""ugly people"" further compounds the offense by perpetuating negative stereotypes and creating a hostile environment for the targeted group.

The tweet promotes using physical force in response to witnessing sexual assault, advocating for potentially excessive violence. Key points include:

1. **Advocating Violence**: Encouraging readers to ""knock them out professionally"" if they witness a sexual assault.
2. **Repetition of Actions**: The repetitive phrasing ""make sure you do what you can to make sure you do what you can..."" emphasizes the urgency and intensity of the advocated response.

The text's promotion of violence as a solution, especially in such an emotionally charged context, borders on inciting aggressive behavior which could be considered offensive or even crossing into hate speech due to its potential to encourage harm. The lack of a specific target group might prevent it from being classified as targeted hate speech but the overall tone and message lean towards an classification of at least ""offensive"".

In conclusion, while the tweet doesn't contain explicit slurs or directly target a demographic, its promotion of violent solutions and aggressive language leans more towards an ""offensive"" rather than ""normal"" categorization.",22.42,[-2.3984935  5.8528733 -5.116553  ...  7.720108  -4.385424   1.2413447],1," offensive.

Key features such as ""ass raped"" and particularly the slur ""sandniggers"" contribute significantly to this classification.

The term ""sandniggers"" is an intensely derogatory and racist slur combining references to sand (implying desert regions associated with Arab and Islamic countries) with a highly offensive term for black people. Its use intends to dehumanize and vilify individuals of Arab descent or those following Islam.

Moreover, the phrase ""getting ass raped"" evokes extreme violence and degradation. Coupled with ""sandniggers"", it reveals a disturbing intent to inflict severe harm on the targeted group, inciting hate and violence against them.

The tweet's vulgar language and aggressive tone clearly aim to offend and degrade its target based on ethnicity and religion. It perpetuates toxic stereotypes and seeks to provoke anger and division. 

In conclusion, this text is classified as hate speech due to its use of an explicit ethnic slur and violent imagery intending to dehumanize a targeted group based on their race and faith.

- The tweet text contains a direct insult using the term ""faggot,"" which is a homophobic slur aimed at individuals identifying as homosexual. This language is explicitly hostile and serves to demean and marginalize based on sexual orientation.
  
- Key features include aggressive verbs like ""suck"" and ""out"", combined with the pejorative noun ""faggot"". The combination of these terms is meant to offend and assert dominance over the target, reinforcing a negative stereotype.

- The tweet is clearly directed at an individual or group identified by their homosexuality, showing intent to insult and cause harm. This specific targeting underpins its classification as not just offensive but potentially escalating to hate speech.

The text falls into the hate speech category due to its use of highly derogatory language and historical inaccuracies aimed at inciting hatred towards a specific religious group. 

Key features such as ""nazism"" and particularly the term ""kike,"" which is an extremely offensive slur targeting Jewish people, support this classification. The reference to ""butchers"" further intensifies the hostility by characterizing a religious leader in an extremely negative light.

The text specifically targets the Jewish community by comparing historical events inaccurately and employing an anti-Semitic slur. This creates a narrative that promotes prejudice and hatred towards this group.

The tone is highly inflammatory, with the user's intent clearly being to provoke animosity. By distorting historical facts about sensitive political ideologies (Nazism and Communism) and their treatment of religious groups, the user exacerbates the offense.

Key features supporting an 'offensive' classification:
- Accusations of laughing at a child rape victim 
- Claims of turning back on attacked military personnel
- Alleging the sale of uranium rights to Russia without approval

These elements together create a hostile narrative that disparages and insults the target through serious, unsubstantiated allegations.

The tone is aggressive, using sensational claims to attack character and integrity. The lack of specific names somewhat obscures the target but the accusations remain highly inflammatory and damaging.

Key features such as ""kike,"" a highly offensive slur referring to Jews, and ""goyim,"" a term used by some to deride non-Jews, especially in an antisemitic context, are central to this classification.

The tweet directly targets those of the Jewish faith and indirectly vilifies adherents of Islam or other non-Jewish religions by suggesting they would seek to ""exterminate"" non-Jews. This promotes a conspiracy theory that fosters animosity and violence between different religious groups.

Moreover, the tone is aggressive and accusatory, contributing to an environment of hostility and intolerance. The context implies the speaker is frustrated at the target's perceived failure to eliminate ""goyim,"" further entrenching divisions.

1. The label 'normal' suggests that while the sentiment expressed may be negative, it does not contain elements of hate speech or extreme offensiveness.

2. Key features: Despite containing a strong word like ""hate"", there is no specific target mentioned or any indication of broader prejudice based on race, religion, gender, etc. The absence of these elements prevents classification as hate speech.

3. Target: There isn't enough context to determine a specific group being targeted. Without additional information, it's hard to gauge the user's intent definitively.

4. Context and tone: In isolation, this phrase carries negative sentiment but without further details about who is being addressed or why, it remains in the realm of general displeasure rather than outright hostility or prejudice.

5. Conclusion: While ""hate"" is a strong term, its usage here lacks the critical elements that would reclassify this text as hate speech or even overtly offensive.

However, without more context about the conversation or the speaker's intent, it's challenging to definitively categorize this as hate speech or purely offensive.

- The text seems to be a response to someone else's statement about not liking ""darkskin women"" and takes issue with jokes that suggest extreme violence against them.
- It uses the term ""my nigga,"" which can be a colloquial, friendly term among some communities but is also highly sensitive and potentially offensive when used out of context or by individuals outside those communities.
- The message appears to criticize the normalization of violent threats or jokes directed at women, especially those with darker skin tones.

Given these points, while the language and topic are definitely sensitive and the tone is impassioned, it's not entirely clear that this tweet is promoting hate or offensively targeting a group. It could be interpreted as critiquing attitudes that normalize violence against marginalized groups. 

Therefore, classifying it as ""normal"" might undershoot the complexity of the content and its potential impact. The classification would benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the conversation's context and the speaker's intent.

Explanation: The user input contains a direct threat of violence and the use of the racial slur ""nigga,"" which is a derogatory term targeting African Americans. This combination of elements constitutes hate speech due to its hostile, demeaning nature towards the targeted group, promoting harm and reinforcing negative stereotypes.

- The term ""niglet"" is an extremely derogatory slur used against African-Americans, revealing the deep-seated racism behind the text.
- References to ""stomped"" indicate an intent to physically harm or even kill, further intensifying the hate speech classification.
- Mentioning historical figures like Hitler in this context draws a disturbing parallel and shows an admiration for genocidal ideologies.

The use of such overtly racist slurs combined with violent intentions leaves no doubt that this is clear-cut hate speech targeting African-Americans. The reference to marching to repeal the 13th amendment (which abolished slavery) further highlights the user's regressive and oppressive views.

The tweet contains multiple derogatory terms targeting various ethnic and religious groups. The inclusion of highly inflammatory language such as ""jew,"" ""spic,"" and ""kneegrow"" directly contributes to its classification as hate speech.

This text explicitly targets Jewish, Hispanic, and African individuals in a negative context, linking these groups to a sports team's broadcasting crew. By contrasting the ethnic background of the crew with the expected performance of the predominantly white players and fanbase, the tweet aims to stir division and promote bigotry.

The use of such language in a public forum exacerbates its offensiveness, as it normalizes and perpetuates prejudices against these groups.

In conclusion, this text is classified as hate speech due to its usage of extreme slurs and clear intent to demean and marginalize specific ethnic and religious communities.",17.59,[-1.858045   0.6644186  1.040062  ...  6.6061454 -1.5703176  3.681454 ],0, hate speech.

- The tweet uses the term ""muzzie,"" which is a pejorative slur referring to Muslims. This key feature suggests an underlying prejudice and hostility towards the target group.
  
- By employing such language in reference to Arabs and Islam, the tweet perpetuates negative stereotypes and contributes to an atmosphere of intolerance and bigotry.

- While no specific incident or individual is mentioned, the generalization and demeaning tone indicate a dismissive attitude toward an entire religious community.

The tweet labels them as ""refugees"" (presumably a typo for 'refugees', an altered spelling of refugees), suggesting they are unwelcome or a burden.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- The combination of the vulgar interjection ""fuck"" with the pejorative term ""nigger"", amplifying the offensiveness.
- The phrase ""snow nigger"" appears to be a compound slur, likely combining ""snow"", often used to deride white people, with ""nigger"", an extremely insulting and oppressive term for black individuals.

The tweet's target is both African and Caucasian races, as it seems to mock or insult individuals of mixed heritage or those perceived as not fitting neatly into either category. The aggressive tone and the use of a taboo racial slur indicate a clear intent to demean and provoke outrage based on race.

In conclusion, this text warrants classification as hate speech because:
- It employs an unambiguous and severe racial epithet in ""nigger"", which is intrinsically linked to ideologies of white supremacy and black oppression.
- The phrase is weaponized with profanity to maximize the offense and hostility.
- It overtly attacks individuals on the basis of race, promoting bigotry and intolerance.

3. By calling her manipulative (""playin both sides"") and dishonest (""tellin lies""), it perpetuates negative stereotypes about women being untrustworthy.

1. **Neutral Perspective**: The tweet discusses a political topic — the construction of a wall and the stance of the Democratic party on immigration issues. While it presents an opinion critical of the Democrats' policies, it does not employ overtly aggressive or discriminatory language that would categorize it as hate speech.

2. **Key Features Absence**: Unlike texts classified as 'offensive' or 'hate speech,' this tweet does not contain any explicit slurs or dehumanizing terms targeting specific groups. The absence of such key features supports the classification of normal.

3. **Political Rhetoric vs. Targeting**: Although the text criticizes the Democratic party's policies and actions regarding immigration, it does not directly target refugees in a manner that can be classified as hate speech. It focuses on policy disagreements rather than attacking an ethnic or social group based on inherent characteristics.

4. **Context and Tone Evaluation**: The context is political, discussing border security and voter ID laws. The tone is critical but stops short of employing the vitriol typical of hate speech. The reference to ""sanctuary cities"" and ""deported"" indicates a debate on legal procedures rather than expressing malice towards individuals.

5. **Conclusion**: After analyzing the text for its content, language, and implied intent, it becomes clear that while opinionated, it does not cross into the realm of hate speech or even offensiveness due to the absence of direct personal attacks, slurs, or incitements of violence.

Here's the analysis:

1. The classification of normal implies that while the tweet contains a slur and discusses challenges faced by the speaker, it doesn't cross the line into hate speech or direct offensiveness.

2. Key features like ""faggot"", ""long hair"", and ""feminine tendencies"" could be seen as problematic. However, in this context, they seem to be used self-referentially to describe the author's own experiences and the prejudices they face due to their appearance and gender expression.

3. The targets (homosexual individuals and women) are referenced not in a malicious way but rather in sharing the speaker's personal encounter with bigotry because of their perceived femininity and being a tall white woman.

4. Analyzing the context and tone, it appears more like an attempt at humor or relatability by someone who likely faces these prejudices themselves. It lacks clear intent to harm or promote animosity towards any group.

5.

- The tweet contains the term ""sheboons,"" which is a derogatory and racially charged term used to demean women of African descent. This word choice is pivotal in classifying this text as offensive.

- By employing such language, the author mocks and disparages these individuals based on their race and gender, using their conversation about food benefits as a pretext for expressing bigotry.

- The context implies frustration or annoyance with the targeted group, reinforcing stereotypes of undeserving welfare recipients. 

- Although couched in a seemingly mundane situation, the intent appears to be ridiculing African women beneficiaries by highlighting perceived unimportant concerns (cereal ounces) and utilizing an extreme profanity (""fucking"") to amplify the offense.

2. **Key Features Supporting Re-classification**:
   - The use of ""idiot"" as an opener sets a hostile tone.
   - The phrase ""jihadi pigs"" employs highly charged, derogatory language targeting followers of Islam, equating them with animals and implying violence, which is deeply offensive and promotes hate against the religious group.
   - Mentioning ""ramalingam"", presumably a victim, alongside ""tamil dalit hindu"", could be interpreted as bringing attention to caste-based issues within Hinduism, potentially stirring controversy.

3. **Impact on Target Group**:
   - The tweet directly targets followers of Islam and Hinduism by using inflammatory language against one group and possibly alluding to sensitive social issues within the other.
   
4. **Context & Tone Assessment**: 
    - The context seems to be a provocative challenge or accusation rather than a neutral statement, given the hostile language used.

5. **Conclusion**:
   While initially labeled as 'normal', this tweet contains strong elements of hate speech against Islam and potentially stirs caste-based controversy within Hinduism.

3. Though it targets political figures associated with homophobia, the tweet's tone is primarily critical of political inaction rather than promoting hate or prejudice against any group.
4. The context implies a disagreement over political accountability and representation for the LGBTQ community.

Explanation: The text contains a racial slur, ""nigger,"" used in a derogatory context. Although the text also touches upon political topics such as election fraud, it does not contain any explicit hate speech towards specific groups based on their race or other protected characteristics. However, using the racial slur in this manner can still be considered offensive and disrespectful to African Americans.

The tweet appears to criticize the Detroit Lions for revoking a season ticket holder's tickets due to his use of a racial slur on Twitter, while suggesting that players are allowed to express themselves freely as long as it aligns with Jewish approval. This creates an us-versus-them narrative which exacerbates the offense by implying a systematic prejudice.

The context and tone suggest an intent to stir controversy and resentment towards both the targeted groups and the NFL's perceived hypocrisy. The choice of words is deliberately provocative, aimed at eliciting strong emotional reactions.

In conclusion, the classification as ""offensive"" is justified by the direct usage of a severe racial slur against African Americans, and the insinuation of Jewish control which demeans the Jewish community.

1. Label Implication: The classification of ""normal"" suggests that the text doesn't contain overt hate speech or explicit offensiveness.

2. Key Features Analysis: However, this conclusion might be premature. The tweet references historical atrocities like the Holocaust and the Tate murders in a speculative, almost fantastical manner. It also seemingly refers to Jewish people as ""moralizers."" While not explicitly hateful, these references could be seen as insensitive or trivializing serious tragedies.

3. Target Group Impact: The text potentially targets Jewish individuals by casting them in an unflattering light as moralizers. However, without clear derision or direct insults, the offensiveness is implicit rather than explicit.

4. Context and Tone Assessment: The speculative nature of the tweet and its discussion of hypothetical scenarios muddles the intent. It doesn't appear to be directly inciting hatred or promoting revisionist history but rather muses on counterfactual outcomes in a detached manner.

5. Justification Conclusion: While not overtly hateful, the flippant references to serious historical tragedies and the portrayal of Jewish people as moralizers could be viewed as insensitive. However, without clearer indicators of malice or direct offense, classifying it as normal is understandable though potentially generous.

The usage of ""<number>"" throughout the text could be interpreted as an attempt to mimic or mock Asian languages, which is a common racist trope. The phrase ""ching chong"" is also a derogatory term used to make fun of Asian language and culture. 

This tweet targets Asians by using these mocking terms in a dismissive and derisive manner. The user's intent seems to be belittling or insulting the target group through the use of this language.

In conclusion, based on the presence of explicit racist language and the targeting of an ethnic group, this text is classified as hate speech.

There is no direct targeting of any group with hostility or hate speech elements present in this text. The tone appears to be one of discovery and mild humor regarding their extended family background, rather than an intent to offend or promote bigotry towards specific ethnic groups. 

Thus, while the term ""hillbilly"" might raise eyebrows under different circumstances, its usage here does not elevate the text into a category of hate speech or even offensiveness due to lack of malicious intent and absence of direct harm or denigration towards any particular community.

Key features such as ""trailer"" and ""trash"" are used in a negative context to demean an individual, linking their perceived lower social status with moral decay.

The phrase ""trailer trash"" specifically targets individuals living in trailer parks or from lower-income backgrounds, insinuating that the subject's relocation to Pasco has led to her moral and societal decline. The term is loaded with classist prejudice and perpetuates negative stereotypes about people from certain socioeconomic backgrounds.

Moreover, the tweet implies a transformation of the individual upon moving to Pasco, suggesting that the location itself inherently degrades its residents. This further solidifies the classification as hate speech due to its promotion of prejudiced societal hierarchies based on both geography and economic status.

In conclusion, the usage of explicitly classist language aimed at stigmatizing a particular group within society justifies this tweet's classification as hate speech. Its intention to demean and degrade an individual based on perceived socioeconomic inferiority aligns with the characteristics typically associated with hate speech.",27.67,[ 1.3451772  3.1994221 -4.7688994 ...  9.375835   2.1399348  1.142259 ],0," offensive.

These terms have historically been used to demean and stereotype individuals of Asian descent, contributing significantly to the classification of this text as hate speech. The direct targeting of an individual with these slurs further emphasizes the hostile intent behind the statement.

The tone is overtly aggressive and the user's intent appears to be to belittle and offend based on race. There is no context in which ""ching chong"" could be seen as anything other than a racial slur.

However, it does include some aggressive language and personal attacks, such as ""mongoloid"" and accusing someone of creating a fake account.

Key features that stand out:
- Use of ""nazi"", though not directly aimed at a group but rather an individual in a hostile manner.
- Phrase ""mongoloid"" is an ableist slur, which is definitely problematic language.
- Accusation of creating a fake account adds to the conflictual tone.

The target here seems to be another user or users based on the context, though no specific demographic group is mentioned. The tweet expresses frustration and accuses someone of strange behavior and not understanding democratic principles, but doesn't cross into organized hate speech against a protected group.

In terms of impact, while it uses harsh language towards an individual, it lacks broader generalizations or calls to action against a group that would qualify as typical of hate speech. 

The tone is adversarial and hostile, indicative of a heated argument or conflict rather than calm discussion. The user's intent appears to be to insult and discredit the target through personal attacks.

In conclusion, while the language used is aggressive and some terms could be considered ableist slurs, the tweet seems more aligned with an interpersonal dispute rather than promoting systemic hatred towards a demographic group. It walks the line but doesn't quite cross into hate speech territory based on common definitions. However, the ableist term ""mongoloid"" pushes it into at least mildly problematic territory.

- The tweet sets up a contrast between a ""good swede name"" (presumably referring to a Scandinavian or Nordic background) and the targeted individual, insinuating that the latter is inherently bad or unworthy.

The presence of this word in the context of expressing dissatisfaction with the cost of college education contributes significantly to the categorization.

1. **Hate Speech Implication**: The use of ""kike"" in any context automatically places the text within the realm of hate speech due to its deep historical roots in anti-Semitic bigotry and its severe offensiveness.

2. **Key Features Supporting Classification**:
   - The term ""kike"" is a critical key feature that supports the classification as hate speech. It's an unmistakable ethnic slur used against Jewish people, and its usage here is likely to cause significant offense and distress.

3. **Impact on Target Group**:
   - The target of this slur is the Jewish community. By employing such a term in relation to colleges being ""rip offs,"" the tweet not only demeans the target group but also perpetuates negative stereotypes about their role in financial matters.

4. **Context and Tone**:
   - The user expresses frustration with their personal circumstances, which might have influenced the choice of words. However, this does not mitigate the fact that they opted to use a term deeply associated with hate to make their point.

5. **Conclusion Justifying Classification**:
    - Despite the personal context of dissatisfaction with education costs and life situation, the inclusion of the slur ""kike"" places this tweet firmly in the category of hate speech. The term is intrinsically linked to anti-Semitic sentiment, and its use here, regardless of the intent behind it, reinforces historic biases against the Jewish community.",38.04,"[ 0.14339936 -3.3565795  -2.9475958  ...  5.747119   -1.66618

- The tweet contains explicit language (""fucking"") which contributes to its classification as offensive. This strong expletive conveys intense dislike and frustration towards the city of Atlanta.
  
- While not directly targeting a group or individual, the harsh wording and tone create an overall negative sentiment that could be seen as off-putting by some readers.
  
- The key feature ""fucking"" intensifies the hate speech, indicating strong disdain for the city due to its smell being compared to feces. This comparison adds to the offense caused.

**Conclusion**: 
The tweet is classified as offensive primarily because of its use of explicit language and negative sentiment expressed towards Atlanta and GSU's campus. The expletive ""fucking"" significantly contributes to making the statement not just a casual dislike but a more intense level of hatred, warranting the classification as 'offensive'.",21.74,[ 0.4836139 -1.5462177 -3.689147  ... 12.016958  -8.543129   3.1460536],2, offensive

The tweet's classification as hate speech is primarily due to the use of the term ""beaner,"" which is a well-known ethnic slur targeting individuals of Mexican descent. This pejorative term is used in a context where the individual is mentioned alongside Atomwaffen, a neo-Nazi group known for its violent extremism.

Key Features and Target:
- The term ""beaner"" is highly derogatory and contributes significantly to the hate speech classification.
- The reference to Atomwaffen further amplifies the hate-filled intent, as it connects the targeted ethnic group with an organization known for violence and bigotry.

Assessment of Context and Tone:
The tweet appears to mock or deride a Hispanic individual who reported on Atomwaffen's activities, thus promoting a negative stereotype. The user's choice of words indicates a clear bias against Hispanics and demonstrates support for violent white supremacist groups.

Conclusion:
Given the use of ""beaner,"" its historical context as an ethnic slur, and the association with a neo-Nazi group, this tweet is unequivocally categorized as hate speech. It targets Hispanic individuals by employing language meant to demean and incite hatred or violence towards them, thereby reinforcing negative stereotypes and promoting division.",28.35,[-3.5577075  3.8725908 -2.3357565 ... 10.200135  -7.2807093  2.550515 ],0," offensive.

The phrase ""only a female nigger could be so dumb"" encapsulates a deeply ingrained prejudice, suggesting that this group is inherently inferior intellectually. 

Key features supporting this classification include the combination of gender-specific (""female"") and racially charged language (""nigger""). This creates a compound effect, amplifying the insult's impact and reflecting a bigoted worldview.

The text explicitly targets two groups: African Americans and women, deploying one of the most severe racial slurs in English. Its derogatory nature leaves no ambiguity regarding the user's intent to demean and degrade based on race and gender.

Considering the historical context and potency of the language used, it's evident that the tweet aims to incite hatred or contempt towards the specified group. This intent is further confirmed by the dismissive tone conveyed through ""lol"" and ""so dumb"", trivializing the gravity of such a statement.

In conclusion, this text falls into the hate speech category due to its unambiguous use of an extreme racial slur directed at a specific demographic, conveying a clear message of bigotry and inferiority.

3. The tweet's reference to ""the white bitches"" explicitly identifies the intended audience or group being targeted by the text. This specificity further supports the classification of the text as offensive, as it makes clear who is being insulted.
4. While the overall context appears to be lighthearted - discussing karaoke song preferences - the use of a gendered racial slur injects animosity into an otherwise benign discussion. The tone, therefore, reinforces the intent to offend rather than simply commenting on musical tastes.
5. In conclusion, the tweet's classification as ""offensive"" is warranted by its inclusion of a derogatory term targeting a specific demographic group in a negative light.

The key features are the mention of a black woman being raped by a white man in a show, which is indeed a serious topic but is not directed at any individual or group in a demeaning way within this tweet. The user seems to express disapproval towards the writer for creating such content and then thanking them, perhaps sarcastically.

The tone appears to be critical of the described situation rather than advocating for it. There's no clear intent to demean or harm any specific target based on race, gender, or other factors. 

In conclusion, while the subject matter is grave and potentially disturbing, the tweet itself does not contain direct hate speech or personal offense towards a group or individual. Its critical stance on a fictional but troubling scenario aligns with the classification of normal under the given context and content.",26.1,"[ 1.6643301  -0.7929169   0.55363774 ...  9.902842   -1.6654382

1. The tweet contains an explicit, highly derogatory racial slur (""nigger"") targeting African individuals.

2. Key features: 
   - The term ""nigger"" is a severe and provocative epithet that promotes bigotry and animosity towards the African community.

3. Target:
   - This language is directed at individuals of African descent, intending to degrade and demean based on race.

4. Context and tone indicate an intent to create discomfort or hostility in a social setting (a restaurant) by suggesting an adverse reaction to the mere presence of African employees.

5. In conclusion, the use of an extreme racial slur with no context that could possibly mitigate its offensiveness justifies this text's classification as hate speech.

The author's expectations for better conduct from this group add an element of sadness to the tone but do not cross into hate speech or overtly offensive language.

Key features supporting this classification include:

1. Acknowledgment of ""fundamental shittiness"" causing negative behaviors - This suggests a general critique rather than specific targeting.
2. Comparison between ""queer community"" and ""cishet community"" - The author is drawing a parallel, not inciting hate or offense against either group.
3. Expression of disappointment - The tone conveys sadness over the prevalence of bigotry, indicating the author's disapproval.

A more appropriate classification would be ""hate speech"" due to the use of a highly offensive racial slur (""niggas""). This term is extremely derogatory and targets African Americans in a demeaning manner.

The key feature supporting this reclassification is the explicit use of the slur, which carries historical connotations of hatred and oppression. The phrase ""it niggas out here begging me"" employs the slur to degrade an unspecified group, implying they are desperate or inferior.

Given this context and tone, the user's intent appears to be denigrating and demeaning a specific racial group, thus aligning with common definitions of hate speech.

1. Label Implication: 
   The label 'Normal' suggests that the content does not contain elements of hate speech or offense.

2. Key Features:
   There are no explicit key features present in this text that would indicate it as being either hate speech or offensive. 

3. Impact on Target Group:
   While the tweet mentions ""gay"", which could potentially reference a target group (homosexual), it does so without any negative connotations or derision.

4. Context and Tone:
   The tone appears to be lighthearted, perhaps even self-referential humor regarding one's personal identity within a fictional universe context (""jedi turned revan""). 

5. Conclusion: 
   Overall, the tweet doesn't display hostility or derision towards any group or individual and instead seems to be an expression of personal identity in a playful manner.

Key features such as 'demented', 'thot', 'witch', and 'negresses' directly contribute to this classification by using dehumanizing and misogynistic slurs. The phrase 'mistakes shit flinging negresses for almighty god' suggests a belief in the inferiority of African individuals, while 'crawls back into slime hole' further dehumanizes the target group.

The tone is extremely hostile and aggressive, with no room for ambiguity about the user's malicious intent towards the targeted groups. This vitriolic language creates an environment that incites hatred and violence against marginalized communities.

- Recognition of different levels of risk for various groups

The text also contains personal attacks, labeling the target as ""globalist,"" ""elitist,"" ""piece of trash,"" ""arrogant,"" ""pompous,"" further contributing to its classification as hate speech. These terms aim to degrade and demean based on perceived political or social affiliations.

The tweet contains the phrase ""dindu nuffin"" which is a deliberate misspelling and mispronunciation of ""didn't do nothing,"" often associated with African American Vernacular English (AAVE).

- The repetition of the phrase ""dindu nuffin"" emphasizes its novelty, potentially perpetuating stereotypes.
- While no specific individual or group is directly targeted, the use of this phrase may contribute to a broader pattern of cultural appropriation and denigration.
  
The tweet's tone seems to trivialize language usage that has been historically mocked or criticized. The intent might not be overtly malicious but can still be considered culturally insensitive.

- The self-referential use of ""my white ass"" in a humorous context, indicating personal jest rather than malice.
- Mention of inability to handle certain food types implies a cultural or preference-based distinction, rather than a negative stereotype.

3. ""Patrol"" - implying systematic targeting or monitoring, which adds to the aggressive tone.

1. The label 'normal' suggests that while the text discusses sensitive topics like racism and political affiliations, it does not cross the line into hate speech or direct offensiveness.
2. Key features: Although no specific key features were identified in the tweet, the discussion around racism, edgy behavior, and political leanings (""libertarian lefties"", ""maga hat"") are central to understanding its context. These phrases indicate a critique of hypocrisy among certain groups rather than promoting hate or offense.
3. The target groups mentioned are ""Arab"" and people wearing ""maga hats"", often associated with conservative political views in the United States. However, instead of attacking these groups directly, the tweet criticizes individuals within those communities for their hypocritical behavior.
4. The tone is critical but not aggressive or inflammatory. It points out perceived hypocrisy rather than promoting harm or prejudice towards any group.

- The acknowledgment of providing comfort to friends during difficult storylines (""kill your gays moment""), which implies empathy.
- No usage of slurs or clearly inflammatory language is detected.

The target group seems to be the user's queer friends and shared TV shows. However, there's no direct or indirect insult or negative generalization aimed at them.

Considering the context and tone, it appears to be a casual conversation about shared experiences with media and its impact on friends. The user expresses solidarity rather than contempt or hostility.

The tweet text contains multiple crude and explicit slurs targeting the homosexual community ('faggot'), women ('cunt,' 'slut'), and general insults ('dickhead', 'fucking'). The use of these aggressive terms without context suggests an intent to offend and demean. 

Key Features:
- Homophobic slur ""faggot"" directly targets the homosexual community.
- Misogynistic slurs ""cunt"" and ""slut"" degrade women.
- Profanity like ""dickhead"" and ""fucking"" intensify the offensiveness.

The combination of these inflammatory words aimed at marginalized groups makes the text highly provocative and abusive. The absence of any context to justify their use further solidifies its classification as purely offensive language intended to insult and harm the targeted demographics.

2. There are no key features that indicate targeting of any group in a negative manner. The words ""women"", ""wine"", and ""men"" are neutral descriptors when used in this context.

3. No specific target audience or group is referenced in the tweet. It appears to be a general statement rather than directed at anyone in particular.

4. While the tone could be seen as slightly suggestive due to the phrase ""women and wine"", it does not cross the line into explicit offensiveness or misogyny. The addition of ""undo men laughing"" adds an element of levity.

1. **Racial Slur**: The term ""nigger"" is an egregious and historically weighted slur directed at individuals of African descent. Its usage immediately categorizes the text as hate speech.
2. **Dehumanization**: Mentioning being ""hungry for a nigger leg"" is not only grotesque but also dehumanizing, reducing the targeted group to mere objects for consumption. This contributes further to the classification of hate speech.
3. **Target Group**: The text explicitly targets individuals of African descent and makes reference to Islamic dietary practices (""halal""), indicating an intent to offend or incite hatred against these groups.

The tone of the text is highly aggressive and inflammatory, and its intent appears to be provoking visceral disgust or fear in readers. This tweet aims not only to demean but also to foster a sense of threat towards the target group, which is a hallmark of hate speech.

   - The term ""mussie world"" is a distorted reference to Muslim-majority countries, demonstrating a prejudiced view.
3. Impact on target group: 
   - The tweet directly attacks Islam and equates the refugee with being disloyal to America. This promotes animosity towards both Muslims and refugees.

2. The phrase ""hillbillies"" with its associated stereotypes about socioeconomic status and hygiene perpetuates negative assumptions about certain rural communities, particularly those of Caucasian ethnicity in this context.
3. The reference to washing clothes and being naked underscores the economic disparity in a mocking tone, further adding to the offensiveness.

The key features - ""nigger"", ""kike"", and especially the compound ""niggerkike"" - are blatantly hostile terms meant to dehumanize and vilify African and Jewish people. Their inclusion leaves no doubt about the user's malevolent intent.

However, it is worth noting that the term ""nigga"" is a variant of a highly controversial and historically loaded word. Despite this, in certain contexts, particularly within specific communities or amongst friends, this term may be used casually without intended malice. 

Key features influencing the classification:
- The use of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and informal language suggests a casual, conversational tone.
- Absence of direct attacks or denigration of any group based on race, ethnicity, religion etc.

Target evaluation:
- No specific target group is referenced in the text, mitigating potential for hate speech or overt offensiveness.

Contextual analysis:
- Without further context, it's challenging to ascertain the user's full intent. The phrase could be interpreted as expressing a close bond or affiliation with ""this nigga"", rather than conveying animosity or aggression.
  
Conclusion: While acknowledging the charged nature of the language used, in isolation and without additional indicators of hate speech or offensiveness, this text is classified as normal based on the analysis. However, use of such terms should be approached with caution due to their sensitive history and potential to cause harm if misapplied.",29.59,"[ 1.0124949   5.93808    -0.23940125 ... 10.569658   -4.2845707

Explanation: The text contains a derogatory term and implies a submissive or servile relationship that could be perceived as demeaning towards the person referred to as ""nigga."" However, it does not contain explicit hate speech and is more subtle in nature compared to the first example provided. Therefore, it is classified as offensive.

Contextually, this text is not identical to the first example due to its nuanced language and lack of overt hostility or targeted offense towards a particular group. Nonetheless, it still contains offensive language that could be perceived as disrespectful and demeaning towards certain individuals. Therefore, the ""offensive"" label seems appropriate based on the given context and examples provided."

This classification is justified because the statement does not contain any hate speech or overtly offensive language. The user is simply expressing their sexual orientation openly and directly, which in itself is a neutral act.

There are no key features that suggest hate speech or offensiveness. The mention of being ""very gay"" is a self-identifier and doesn't target any group negatively.

The context appears to be one of personal disclosure rather than an attack or insult aimed at any particular individual or community. The tone is straightforward, without malice or aggression.

The text falls into the 'Offensive' category due to the following reasons:

1. The implication of 'systematically raped and converted' suggests violent persecution of a group, which is deeply disturbing and insensitive.

2. Key features like 'not illegal immigrants' convey a negative sentiment towards refugees by labeling them as 'illegal', perpetuating an unwelcoming stance that can be seen as xenophobic or exclusionary.

3. Although the text claims to love Indian Muslims and Kashmiris, the overall context targets refugees in a harshly negative light, which could foster animosity or prejudice against this group.

4. The tone is apologetic yet uncompromising, which adds nuance but doesn't mitigate the offensiveness caused by the choice of words like 'systematically raped and converted'.

5.

- The absence of inflammatory terminology or direct insults aimed at any group.
- The tweet seems to offer an opinion on geopolitical perceptions rather than inciting hatred or prejudice against a particular community.

The text's reference to Hindu and Muslim refugees is more about their supposed allegiances to countries (India for Hindus, other unspecified nations for Muslims) than expressing hostility towards either group.

Explanation: The text contains inflammatory language and makes distinctions between Hindu and Muslim refugees based on their religious identities and the countries they perceive as their saviors or places of refuge. This perpetuates harmful stereotypes and fuels division, demonstrating a clear intent to offend and marginalize individuals based on their religion.

It is essential to remember that all refugees deserve respect, empathy, and support, regardless of their religious beliefs or the countries they come from. We must strive for a world where everyone can live safely and peacefully, irrespective of their backgrounds or identities.

To counteract this offensive text, it would be beneficial to focus on promoting messages of unity, inclusiveness, and empathy towards refugees of all religious backgrounds. Encouraging dialogue and education about the shared human experiences and needs of refugees can help foster understanding, compassion, and a more inclusive society for everyone."

1. The label 'normal' suggests that while the language used is harsh, it does not cross the line into hate speech or direct offensiveness. The user's choice of words like 'psycho' and 'scary as hell' are expressive but lack the intentional malice associated with hate speech.

2. Key features that support this classification include the absence of targeted slurs or group-specific attacks. Although the language is strong, it does not promote violence or express systematic prejudice which would warrant a hate speech label.

3. The target of criticism, Stephen Miller, is a public figure and the user's opinion, though strongly worded, falls within the bounds of protected political discourse. It does not incite harm or advocate for exclusion based on identity characteristics.

Key features supporting this classification include the use of the term ""nigger,"" which is an egregious racial slur, and the call to action in ""kill nigger babies."" This phrase not only advocates for violence but specifically targets innocent children based on their race.

The reference to ""brother azz"" and ""god work"" indicates a self-righteous justification for this hate speech, positioning the violent acts as divinely sanctioned. The inclusion of religious figures like ""st robert ray"" further attempts to legitimize the hate speech by associating it with respected religious leaders.

The tweet's aggressive tone, evidenced by phrases like ""raise hell,"" is hostile and inflammatory, clearly intended to incite harm against African Americans. The classification as hate speech reflects the combination of explicit bigotry and the incitement to violence based solely on race. This text violates fundamental principles of human decency and poses severe risks by promoting acts of brutality against an entire group based on their ethnicity.

In conclusion, this text is classified as hate speech due to its blatant use of a severe racial slur, open advocacy for violent acts against innocent children based on their race, and the attempt to justify these atrocities through religious framing. Its intent to harm and dehumanize African Americans based solely on their race is clear, making it an unequivocal example of hate speech.",34.33,[ 1.9378387  0.5417078 -0.8234886 ...  6.5723085 -0.6562789  1.1413096],0," offensive.

- The phrase ""story wise"" implies that the user is evaluating the narrative impact of the proposed event rather than advocating for real harm.

The text does not target any real-world group or individual and remains confined to discussing fictional characters. The tone reflects a casual fan's opinion on story development rather than an intent to offend or incite hatred.

1. The use of the word ""nigger"" is a clear indication of hate speech. This term is highly derogatory and is used to demean African-Americans.
2. The reference to ""pitch segregation"" suggests the promotion of racial separation, which is a form of bigotry.
3. The statement ""all Tucker kept saying was that race hatred"" implies an endorsement or tolerance of such sentiment.

1) The use of ""nigga"" - This term has a long history of being used to demean and dehumanize black individuals. Its usage here, even if intended positively, still perpetuates that harm.
2) Intense profanity - The f-word intensifies the statement's impact and indicates strong emotions.

Target group:
Black individuals are directly targeted by the language used.

Context/Tone:
- Seems to be admiring someone while using a term of hate
- Profanity adds intensity but doesn't clarify intent (genuine admiration vs. sarcasm)

Key features such as the use of the term ""nigger"" and references to ""brown towns"" highlight the deeply offensive nature of this content, which is aimed at African and minority groups.

The language used in this text is not only inflammatory but also perpetuates a narrative of division and supremacy, with the suggestion that cities were made ""great again"" after the removal of non-white individuals. This showcases a clear intent to demean and marginalize based on race, aligning with traditional hate speech tactics.

The term ""nigga"" is often used colloquially in certain communities and does not inherently denote hate speech or offensiveness when used within specific cultural contexts. Without additional context indicating negative intent, the classification of normal is justified.

Key points supporting this classification:
- The usage of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) terms like ""nigga"" can vary greatly depending on user intent and community norms.
- No explicit hate speech indicators or direct targeting of a group in a derogatory manner are present.
- Mentioning Elon Musk's truck doesn't imply negative sentiment towards any specific group.

It appears to discuss political tactics without directly attacking any group or individual.

The key features seem to be missing, which would have provided more insight into specific terms that might influence interpretation. However, based on the available context, no particular words or phrases stand out as highly inflammatory or targeted.

The text references strategies like name-calling (""deplorables"", ""racists"", ""white supremacists"") and predicting political outcomes (impeachment), which are common in political discourse. These don't inherently qualify as hate speech unless coupled with direct threats, slurs, or calls to violence.

In terms of tone, it is somewhat sarcastic or mocking, questioning the effectiveness of these named tactics. But sarcasm alone doesn't equate to offensiveness or hatefulness.

The missing target information also limits analysis of whether any specific group was maliciously attacked or slandered based on protected characteristics.

Key features supporting this classification include:

1. The usage of ""dykes"": This is an explicit slur aimed at homosexual women.
2. Public disclosure: Sharing sensitive information about a deceased relative publicly can be seen as invasive and insensitive.

The tweet targets the lesbian community by employing demeaning language, creating an environment that marginalizes individuals based on their sexual orientation. 

Although the intent behind sharing this family anecdote is unclear, the choice of words and public exposure of personal matters contribute to its classification as offensive. The Church's presence in the story further intensifies the offense due to religious contexts often being associated with judgments or exclusions regarding homosexuality.

Upon analysis, it should be categorized as hate speech for the following reasons:

1. **Label Implication**: Hate speech involves language that attacks, demeans, or incites violence or prejudiced action against a group based on ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.
2. **Key Features**: The crucial phrase here is ""this nigger does not love me enough."" The term ""nigger"" is an egregious racial slur used to demean African Americans and perpetuate the history of slavery and oppression.
3. **Target Group**: The text explicitly targets individuals of African descent with the use of a highly offensive and historically charged slur.
4. **Context and Tone**: While the tweet includes emoji, often associated with casual or light-hearted communication, the use of ""nigger"" in any context is deeply inflammatory and hostile. The tone, despite the emojis, carries a sense of frustration or grievance, which can amplify the harm done by the language used.
5. **Conclusion**: Given that the text employs a severe racial slur to express dissatisfaction or resentment, it crosses the line into hate speech. Such language cannot be classified as normal due to its profound offensiveness and potential to incite harm against the targeted group.

The key features in this text include the use of the n-word which directly contributes to its classification as hate speech.

The user's choice of words like ""shithole"" to describe these countries reveals a strong negative bias and an attempt to equate them with something disgusting or inferior. This kind of language has historical precedents in denigrating regions and their populations based on ethnicity and socio-economic status, which places this tweet firmly within the hate speech category.

Moreover, the mention of ""extra covfefe"" seems to be a reference to a previous controversial statement made by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who was criticized for using the term ""shithole countries"" in describing African nations. This allusion further reinforces the tweet's alignment with hate speech ideologies.

Key Features and Analysis:
- The term ""muzzies,"" a pejorative shorthand for Muslims, is key in classifying this text as offensive. It perpetuates negative stereotypes against followers of Islam.
  
- While not explicitly stated, the accompanying emoji (\ud83d\ude1c) could imply an action or outcome that the user finds unfavorable or frustrating due to ""muzzies."" This adds a layer of negativity towards the targeted group.

Impact on Target and Context:
- The term directly targets Muslims, casting them in a negative light without providing any context for why they have caused the speaker's frustration.
  
- The post lacks specifics, but its generalizing tone could promote a broad sentiment against all followers of Islam based on an isolated event or perception.

The key features that support this classification are the phrases ""transgender"" and ""muzzrat,"" which are used in a mocking and derisive manner.

The target groups mentioned in the tweet, homosexuals and Islam, are referenced in a demeaning way, further solidifying its categorization as hate speech. The user appears to be equating their self-inflicted pain with becoming part of these marginalized communities in an obviously disparaging attempt at humor.

Furthermore, the context and tone of the message suggest an intent to provoke and offend, rather than contribute meaningfully to any dialogue. This is evidenced by the crude language used and the mocking tone adopted when referring to sensitive social issues.

In conclusion, the tweet's classification as hate speech is justified by its use of explicit slurs, targeting of vulnerable groups, and clear intent to belittle and insult based on identity.

Key points include:

1. **Racial Slur**: The term ""chink"" is an ethnic slur used against individuals of Chinese descent, contributing to the classification as hate speech.
2. **Reference to Slavery**: Mentioning ""slaves"" in relation to the targeted group perpetuates historical injustices and stereotypes, further categorizing this as hate speech.

The tweet's impact on the Asian community is significant due to its use of a known slur and references to slavery, both contributing to a hostile environment for the targeted group. The context and tone reveal an intent to demean and belittle based on race.

In conclusion, the classification of ""hatespeech"" is justified by the presence of explicit language targeting a specific ethnic group and drawing upon historical injustices related to slavery.",17.82,[-3.6644104  2.6024508 -1.2859237 ...  5.899302  -2.9982083  2.7692661],0," offensive.

Key features that support this classification:
- The statement makes broad claims without specific evidence.
- It implies homogeneity in a diverse group based on race, religion, and socio-economic status. 

The tweet's target is unspecified but seemingly refers to a group perceived as powerful or influential. The user seems critical of this group for lacking diversity.

The context and tone are informal and conversational, suggesting the user's personal opinion rather than an intentional slur or attack. This mitigates the potential offensiveness despite the generalization.

Reasoning:
1. The text promotes violence towards a specific individual, which is a clear indication of hate speech.
2. Key features include the use of a highly derogatory term for African Americans and an explicit call to kill the President of the United States. These elements underscore the extreme hostility and prejudice present in the message.
3. By targeting Donald Trump, it not only attacks him personally but also potentially incites violence against those who support him or his policies, extending the hate speech's reach.
4. The context suggests deep-seated animosity due to perceived misuse of power and public funds, illustrating an intent to harm based on political disagreements.
5. In conclusion, the combination of a racial slur with a direct call for violence against a named individual places this text firmly in the category of hate speech. The inflammatory language and the target's high-profile status further highlight its dangerous nature.

This analysis follows the streamlined reasoning framework by focusing on key factors that justify the classification of hate speech.",22.39,[-0.6551273 -1.6770642 -3.2463045 ...  5.2302427 -2.4386516  2.17222  ],1," offensive.

The tweet contains the highly derogatory term ""nigger,"" which is an extreme racial slur directed at African Americans. This term, along with the context of perpetuating negative stereotypes about African American men being irresponsible and criminal, classifies this text as hate speech.

The key feature supporting this classification is the use of the word ""nigger."" This term carries a historical weight of oppression and bigotry and is used here to degrade and insult based on race. The narrative constructed around this slur—implying that the individual's boyfriend, presumably African American, will abandon his responsibilities and commit a crime—exacerbates the hate speech by reinforcing damaging stereotypes.

The tweet targets the African American community by using a term associated with their historical oppression and contemporary bigotry. The reference to the ""single mom"" and ""her nigger bf"" creates a hostile environment that demeans both women and African American men, intensifying the negative impact on these groups.

Given the context of the slur and the demeaning narrative, it's evident that the intent is to offend and spread hate based on race. The tweet's casual use of such language suggests an attempt to normalize bigotry.

In conclusion, this tweet is classified as hate speech due to its inclusion of a severe racial slur and the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about African American men.

The reference to ""constituents begged them to support impeachment"" suggests the context involves political decision-making under pressure.

However, despite mentioning harassment from media and GOP, which could potentially imply negativity or offensiveness, there are no overtly hate speech terms or direct personal attacks used. 

The text highlights the contrast between five women of color who took a stand and five white women who followed eventually, but does so in a matter-of-fact tone without aggressive language.

Given these considerations, the classification as normal seems reasonable because:
1) The tweet reports on political events and behaviors in a descriptive manner.
2) It lacks inflammatory language or personal insults targeting any group or individual.
3) The focus is more on describing the dynamics between different politicians rather than attacking anyone. 

The tweet could potentially be seen as controversial for touching on sensitive political topics, but it avoids crossing the line into hate speech or overt offensiveness through its measured tone and absence of explicit slurs or attacks.

These words serve to dehumanize the targeted African-American individual, Bessie Coleman. The inclusion of her plane accident where she fell to her death adds a morbid angle which intensifies the hate element.

Key features such as ""retarded"", ""nigger"", and the reference to a tragic incident on Google's homepage substantiate this classification. The use of these terms in conjunction with a historical figure who faced significant societal barriers due to her race and gender showcases an intent to demean and insult based on identity.

The text explicitly targets African-Americans and contains elements mocking a Jewish person as evident from the key features. This further amplifies its hate speech categorization by broadening the range of targeted groups.

Key features like ""nigger"" and ""degenerate"" are highly inflammatory, expressing intense bigotry towards African individuals.

The target group, Africans, is directly attacked with dehumanizing terms that perpetuate a history of oppression and violence. The reference to taking a ""leather shampoo courtesy of paul nehlen boot heel"" implies physical assault, escalating the aggression beyond verbal abuse.

The context is devoid of any justifying factors like sarcasm or irony, making the animosity unambiguous. The user's intent appears to be inciting hatred and advocating for violence against the target group based on their race.

The reference to ""head shot"" and the overall tone of excitement about engaging in this violent act against a targeted group further solidify its classification as hate speech. The use of emojis does not mitigate the severity of the language used, which is intended to incite violence or promote hatred based on race.

Given these constraints, I'll focus on what can be inferred:

1. **Label Implication**: The classification is marked as 'normal', suggesting that based on the available information, the text doesn't seem to contain overtly hate speech or offensive content.
   
2. **Key Features**: There's no explicit key feature provided, but ""trailer trash"" stands out. This term is sometimes used pejoratively against individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, which could potentially be classified as 'offensive'.

3. **Target Group**: Without a specified target, it's difficult to assess whether the remark is directed at a specific individual or group. The generic nature of ""our master"" and ""trailer trash"" doesn't offer clear direction.

4. **Context & Tone**: The phrase ""the day our master brought home trailer trash"" might carry an implication of disdain or disapproval. However, without more context, it's hard to determine the speaker's intent with certainty.

**Conclusion**: Given the limited information and lack of explicitly hateful or aggressive language, the classification as 'normal' seems reasonable based on what we have. However, ""trailer trash"" could be considered a pejorative term by some, which might edge this closer to being classified as 'offensive'. Yet, without further context or a specified target, it's prudent not to assume malicious intent, thus maintaining the classification as 'normal'.

Analyzing the context reveals that while the scenario presented is provocative and hypothetical, it's not a direct call to violence nor does it contain slurs or language typically associated with hate speech. The tweet seems to invite reflection rather than incite hatred or harm.

The tweet appears to be targeting a group referred to as ""redneck revolt kids,"" which seems to imply a specific subgroup within a larger community known for certain political or social activism. The use of the term ""communists"" at the end further amplifies the offense by linking this group to an ideology in a derisory manner, showing disdain and disrespect.

The tweet's tone is clearly mocking and belittling, indicating an intent to denigrate rather than engage in constructive dialogue. This context strengthens its classification as ""offensive.""

- The tweet's tone seems to derive amusement from conflict within the targeted group, which can promote an environment of mockery and marginalization towards homosexuals.

The tweet's intent appears to advocate for aggressive action against these groups, with phrases like ""wash away the grime"" implying a desire to cleanse or purge. The reference to using police hoses and dogs suggests an endorsement of forceful measures typically associated with crowd control, elevating the language from merely offensive to threatening in nature.

The tweet targets Arab and Islamic people broadly, painting them as undesirable elements that need to be removed or suppressed. This dehumanizing rhetoric is a hallmark of hate speech.

Explanation:
- The text contains derogatory language towards individuals identified as ""ragheads"" which is considered a racial slur against people of Middle Eastern or Muslim descent. This language targets and demeans a specific group based on their ethnicity, religious beliefs or national origin.
- Additionally, the term ""fleabags"" is often used pejoratively to refer to people in a derogatory way.
- The text does not express an aspiration or a personal desire but rather uses hateful language to describe and demean certain groups of people. This type of speech can contribute to creating a hostile environment, perpetuating negative stereotypes and promoting hate crimes.
- However, the text does not contain explicit threats of violence or advocacy for harm against specific individuals or groups, so it falls under the category of offensive rather than hate speech."

Key features supporting this classification include:
1. The term ""kike"" - an extremely offensive slur used against Jews. Its usage here aims to disparage and insult a specific ethnic group.
2. ""Cernovich can eat a dick"" - This vulgar phrase adds to the overall hostility of the message, showing clear contempt towards Mike Cernovich, likely due to his association with net neutrality.

The text targets Jewish people through the use of the term ""kike,"" making them the intended audience for this hate speech. The author's intent appears to be promoting animosity and prejudice against Jews by linking them pejoratively with a political issue (net neutrality).

In conclusion, the combination of an egregious ethnic slur with aggressive, vulgar language directed at both a group and individual classifies this text as clear-cut hate speech.

Despite containing potentially controversial language (""bitch""), this classification is justified by several factors:

1. The phrase lacks clear contextual indicators of hate speech or targeted offense.
2. It appears to be an informal, self-deprecating statement rather than a malicious attack on any group or individual.
3. Without additional context suggesting otherwise, the term ""bitch"" seems to be used casually and not directed at anyone specifically.

1. **Label Implication**: The classification of hate speech signifies that the content promotes or expresses hatred towards a specific group based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, or religion.
2. **Key Features Support**: The term ""niggas"" is the key feature supporting this classification. Its use in any context is generally considered highly inflammatory and abusive.
3. **Impact on Target Group**: The tweet directly targets African-Americans with a deeply insulting slur, suggesting they want discounts for what seems to be a product or service (""en haut"") but are willing to pay full price for a ""white man brand."" This not only perpetuates stereotypes but also implies an inherent superiority of products associated with Caucasian individuals.
4. **Context and Tone**: The tweet employs a tone that is dismissive and derisive towards the African-American community. It uses a charged, racist term to make a comparison that suggests economic unfairness or prejudice.

In summary, while the topic is sensitive and potentially controversial, the lack of explicit hate speech or personal attacks keeps this within the realm of normal discussion.

This classification is supported by the following points:

1. **Hate Speech Label Implication**: The presence of a recognized slur categorically places the text in the realm of hate speech, as it aims to demean and insult based on ethnicity and religion.
2. **Key Features Supporting Classification**: The term ""muzzy"" is an ethnic slur used pejoratively against individuals of Arab descent or those who practice Islam. Its inclusion in the tweet suggests a prejudiced view towards these groups.
3. **Target Group Impact**: The text directly targets individuals of Arab heritage and followers of Islam, promoting bigotry and antagonism. The slur's presence creates a hostile environment that can incite hatred or prejudice against the target group.
4. **Context and Tone Evaluation**: While the rest of the tweet seems casual, discussing an appointment and using emojis, the inclusion of ""muzzy"" starkly contrasts with this tone. It injects animosity into an otherwise neutral context, revealing a negative intent behind its usage.

**Conclusion**: The tweet's classification as hate speech is justified by the explicit use of a recognized ethnic slur against Arab individuals or those who follow Islam.

The text lacks any clear hate speech or overtly offensive content. While it contains a crude anatomical reference, this alone does not qualify it as hate speech or even necessarily offensive without further context.

Key features:
- The phrase ""white ass nipples"" is mildly vulgar but not directed at any specific group in a derogatory manner.
  
Target: 
- No identifiable target group is referenced or attacked.

Tone and Intent:
- The tone seems to be dismissive or sarcastic, possibly in response to another user's comment. However, without the original context, it's difficult to ascertain the full intent behind the post.

Conclusion:
- While crude, the text does not meet the criteria for hate speech or offensive classification based on the available information. It lacks the key features of targeting protected groups with slurs or promoting violence/hatred. Therefore, it is categorized as neutral, albeit with a caution for its mildly vulgar language that stops short of being overtly hostile or abusive toward any demographic.",22.0,[-1.804186  -1.189702   0.5375541 ...  6.6394167 -1.8877442 -0.6509913],1," offensive.

The text does not contain explicit hate speech or offensive language. While the term ""wigger"" is mentioned, it appears to be a discussion about who should avoid using certain terms. The tweet lacks clear malicious intent towards any group.

Key features:
- Mention of the term ""wigger"": This term can be considered controversial or sensitive in some contexts.
- Reference to someone being white: The text suggests that race may play a role in determining who should use specific language.

Target:
- Caucasians and no specific target group are mentioned, indicating general advice rather than targeting any individual or community.

Tone and context:
- The tweet seems to be offering casual advice or an opinion on appropriate language usage based on one's race.
- There is no overt hostility or aggression in the tone.

Conclusion: 
Although the text mentions a controversial term, it does not display clear hate speech or intent to offend. Rather, it appears to be a discussion about sensitive language use.

   - This classification is justified by the lack of overtly hateful language, direct attacks on individuals/groups, and its use of potentially sensitive terms within a broader social discourse.
   - The text invites reflection on how perceptions change over time regarding complex topics such as violence and revenge in media, aligning it with a normal conversation rather than hate speech or intentionally offensive content.",33.35,[ 1.136263   2.4828527 -6.3739347 ... 11.81264    2.0609436  2.2960162],1, normal

- The tweet text advises caution regarding individuals who frequently joke and struggle to be serious. It lacks any explicitly controversial content or targeted language, making it neutral.
- There are no key features that suggest hate speech or offensiveness. The statement is a general observation or advice without attacking or demeaning any specific group or individual.
- Since the tweet does not target a particular audience in a negative way, its impact remains benign. The intent appears to be sharing personal insight rather than causing offense or harm.
- Considering the context and tone, it seems more like casual social commentary. There's no indication of malice or aggression towards any group.

- tweet_text: ""your friendly moslem who went all allah akhbar today in france""
  
The text, while containing a misspelling of ""moslem"" and referencing the phrase ""allah akhbar,"" does not inherently promote hate or offense towards any group. The term ""friendly"" suggests a positive or neutral tone rather than hostility.

Key points to consider:

1. **Intent**: Despite the potential for misunderstanding due to the phrase ""allah akhbar,"" which is often associated with acts of violence, the context here doesn't clearly indicate an intent to promote hate or offense.
   
2. **Target Group Impact**: The reference to a ""friendly moslem"" and an event in France does not directly attack or vilify any specific group.

3. **Lack of Derogatory Language**: While there is a misspelling that could be seen as mocking, it's not accompanied by other clearly negative terms or sentiments that would categorize this as hate speech.

4. **Context and Tone**: Without additional context to suggest malicious intent or a pattern of targeting specific groups with hostility, the tweet remains in the neutral category.

Conclusion: Although the text contains potentially sensitive references, without clear indications of hate or offense, it's classified as normal. The balance between acknowledging cultural sensitivities and recognizing when texts do not cross into hate speech or offensiveness is crucial here.",33.0,[ 2.822761  -2.7610993 -5.8946986 ...  4.358834  -0.4604855  2.6618493],1, normal

3. Advocating against all third-world immigration based on these unsubstantiated assertions.

The text targets refugees and followers of Islam, painting them as inherently violent invaders threatening European society. Its incendiary tone aims to provoke animosity towards these groups.

The text suggests that the individual, described in an extremely negative light, should be subjected to bullying instead of perpetrating it. This not only encourages violence against the target but also perpetuates stereotypes about their appearance and identity.

By referring to the target as ""the one getting bullied,"" the user implies that this treatment is justified or deserved based on their personal characteristics. The tone is aggressive and inflammatory, contributing to a hostile environment that could incite further harassment or abuse towards the targeted individual or group.

While it doesn't explicitly target a group with hate or severe offensiveness, phrases like ""fuckin magical"" and ""lil hillbilly country babe"" carry a mildly derogatory tone. The use of profanity alongside diminutive language to describe someone based on their perceived cultural background borders on being offensive.

However, the tweet lacks clear indicators of malicious intent or direct targeting of an individual or group, which would warrant a hate speech classification. Its informal and somewhat playful tone suggests it's more likely an ill-advised attempt at humor or casual banter rather than genuine animosity or bigotry.

In conclusion, while not fully neutral due to its questionable language choice, the tweet falls short of meeting criteria for hate speech. A balanced assessment would lean towards classifying it as mildly ""offensive"" based on the key features and their implications, but lacking severe malice or direct harm to a targeted group.

2. **Key Features**: The terms ""Moslem"" – a misrepresentation of 'Muslim', and ""Ban Islam"" are significant contributors to its offensiveness. 
   - ""Moslem"" is an outdated and often perceived as derogatory term for followers of Islam.
   - ""Ban Islam"" suggests a negative action against the Islamic faith, promoting intolerance.

1. The label ""normal"" implies that the content of the text does not contain any explicit hate speech or severely offensive language.
2. While the key features are listed as ""[]"", indicating no specific words or phrases were identified, this often suggests a lack of overtly controversial or inflammatory content.
3. The target is marked as ""None, Other"", which means that there isn't a clear or specific group being targeted by the text's content.

However, upon closer examination of the tweet text:

- ""<user> your actually gonna get raped by bayern bro""

The language used here, specifically the term ""raped"", could be considered highly inappropriate and distasteful due to its reference to sexual violence. Despite this, it doesn't quite meet the criteria for hate speech as it does not target a protected group based on race, ethnicity, religion, etc.

Given that the tweet appears to be a user-to-user interaction without clear context and lacks specific inflammatory language or targeting of a group, it may lean towards being classified as ""offensive"" due to the violent nature of its language.

To improve this analysis in future iterations, consider:

The context implies aggression or conflict with the mention of a traffic incident involving a bus and a person on a bike, which escalates the potential for harm in conjunction with the use of the slur. The reference to ""pissed off"" suggests intense anger or hostility directed at the individual on the bike, further emphasizing the malicious intent behind the language used.

The key features such as ""imported dreamers,"" ""wetback,"" and ""illegal"" are all used in a pejorative sense, contributing to the hostile tone and content of the text. 

The term ""dreamers"" likely refers to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children (DACA recipients), while ""wetback"" is an ethnic slur for Mexicans or other Hispanic people, implying they entered the country illegally by crossing a river. The phrase ""imported dreamers"" furthers this sentiment of xenophobia and opposition to immigration.

Moreover, the tweet suggests that these targeted groups will ""burn the state down,"" promoting a conspiratorial narrative that paints them as inherently destructive and violent. This sort of rhetoric is characteristic of hate speech as it incites fear, hostility, and potential violence against specific demographic groups based on their ethnicity or migration status.

Key features include the pejorative terms ""commies,"" ""mud females,"" and ""muzzie sex attack migrants,"" which convey a strong animus towards certain political, ethnic, and religious groups.

The author employs these derisive labels to denigrate and stereotype these communities. For instance, ""mud females"" likely refers to women of color in a demeaning manner, while ""muzzie sex attack migrants"" vilifies Muslim immigrants by associating them with sexual violence.

Moreover, the text suggests that these groups are perverting the meaning of terms like ""sanctuary"" and ""chastity angels."" This rhetorical strategy seeks to cast aspersions on their character and motives, framing them as threats to societal values.

The tone is highly charged and hostile, indicative of an intent to provoke and offend. The sweeping generalizations and negative characterization aim to foster animosity towards the targeted groups.

- The tweet directly attacks the target group, using crude and hostile terms to demean and dehumanize them. 
- Such language is meant to incite anger or hatred against these communities, making it clear hate speech.

However, there is insufficient context to determine if this constitutes hate speech. The reference to ""chinaman satanist"" could be interpreted as prejudiced language but may also be part of a broader narrative not fully represented in the text snippet.

This term is used in a context that suggests segregation and exclusion based on race or ethnicity, further emphasizing its hate-filled intent. The reference to ""other groups"" having ""white only"" spaces also implies a sense of superiority and entitlement among certain racial groups over others.

The tweet targets the Hispanic community with the use of ""spic,"" a term intended to demean and insult this group. By suggesting that there should be segregated spaces for different ethnicities, it promotes division and intolerance.

While the language used is crude, it lacks any elements of hate speech or targeted offense towards a specific group or individual.

Key features supporting this classification:
- The phrase ""cursed shit"" is an informal and vulgar way to request bizarre or unconventional content. However, it does not contain explicit bigotry or target any protected groups.
- There is no clear indication that the tweet aims to harass, threaten, or promote violence against anyone, which would warrant an offensive or hate speech classification.

The user's intent seems to be expressing a desire for unusual or ""cursed"" content, without aiming to harm or offend. The context and tone are casual and informal, lacking any signs of malice or aggression.

Label: Normal

The tweet text ""£80 of buddha and bitches with beepers"" does not contain any explicit hate speech or directly offensive language. While it uses slang terms like ""bitches"" and ""beepers"", these are not directed at a specific person or group in a derogatory manner within this short excerpt.

Key Features:
- The phrase ""£80 of buddha"" suggests a quantity purchased, likely referring to marijuana colloquially called 'buddha'.
- The terms ""bitches"" and ""beepers"" are slang that can have negative connotations but lack clear context here.
- No explicit targeting or derision of any demographic is evident.

Impact on Target: 
No specific target group is mentioned. The tweet discusses a quantity purchased and associates it with certain slang terms, but doesn't direct this at any individual or community in an aggressive or mocking way based on the given text.

Tone and Intent:
- The tone seems casual and conversational.
- Intent appears to be sharing a personal purchase rather than instigating or insulting anyone. 

Conclusion: 
Considering the ambiguous slang without directly abusive usage, lack of identifiable malice towards a particular group or person, and no clear incitement of harm or hatred in this brief snippet, it's reasonable to classify this tweet as normal based on the information provided.

1. **Label Implication**: Hate speech involves language that expresses prejudice or promotes hatred towards a specific group. The use of highly derogatory and inflammatory terms in reference to an individual and their actions categorizes this text under hate speech.

2. **Key Features**: Terms like ""nigger,"" ""anti white,"" and ""bastard"" are clear indicators of the author's intent to denigrate and spread animosity towards the targeted person and by extension, the entire race. The phrase ""criminal m.l.k. jr"" implies a negative preconception based on identity.

3. **Target Group Impact**: The text explicitly targets African Americans through the use of the term ""nigger,"" which is an egregious racial slur. It also suggests that the individual in question is ""anti-white,"" further polarizing the intended target along racial lines.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**: The context involves an arrest outside a courtroom, with the author suggesting that the outcome should have been more severe due to the individual's perceived anti-white sentiments. This reveals a deep-seated resentment and promotes a narrative of unjust treatment based on race.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the text's use of extreme pejorative terms aimed at maligning an individual based on their race, its reference to a legal proceeding in a negative light, and its overall tone of hostility towards African Americans, this text is unequivocally classified as hate speech.

Explanation: The text contains several instances of racial slurs and derogatory language towards Martin Luther King Jr., who is an African American civil rights activist, and black people in general. These statements express a clear hostility and contempt based on race, which is indicative of hate speech. Additionally, the use of derogatory terms like ""nigger"" and ""anti white American bastard"" is deeply offensive and inflammatory, making it crucial to classify this text as hate speech rather than normal or offensive. This text should not be tolerated or excused due to its harmful nature towards African Americans and its potential to incite further hatred and violence."

- The tweet text includes the explicit usage of the term ""nigger,"" a highly inflammatory and historically charged racial slur. This marks it as hate speech due to its direct targeting of African individuals or those perceived as such.
  
- Key Features: The central feature is the use of the word ""nigger"". This term's historical context and continued use in harassment, intimidation, and expressions of bigotry make it a potent symbol of hatred.

- Target: The tweet directly targets individuals of African descent. Its intent appears to be provocative and insulting based on ethnicity alone.
  
- Context/Tone: The user justifies the slur's usage by attributing it to another's command not to use the word. This context, though attempting humor or defiance, does nothing to mitigate the hatefulness of the language used.

These elements not only denigrate African individuals through a combination of overt racism and dehumanizing imagery, but also incite violence or punitive action against them.

Explanation: This text contains multiple racial slurs (nigger and Nazi), which are used derogatively towards different groups of people. The use of these slurs is intended to incite hatred, aggression, and contempt towards individuals based on their race or ethnicity. The statement ""stupid nigger nazis"" is a compound expression that combines two hateful stereotypes and epithets, further intensifying the hateful and discriminatory nature of the text. Additionally, the phrase ""need to have their noses rubbed in the turds they leave on the carpets"" reinforces a dehumanizing and degrading image towards those being targeted, creating a hostile and threatening environment.

The tweet's usage of the term 'dyke' is a clear indicator of its classification as hate speech. This term is an overtly hostile and derogatory slur targeted at homosexual individuals, particularly those identifying as lesbians. The accompanying language further intensifies the animosity, labeling those who watch Ellen DeGeneres, a well-known lesbian figure, as ""pretty fucking dumb."" 

This combination of a direct homophobic epithet with aggressive language reveals a strong intent to demean and insult based on sexual orientation, which is a hallmark of hate speech. The reference to Ellen DeGeneres and her audience serves to expand the scope of the attack beyond an individual, targeting a broader community associated with her show.

In conclusion, the tweet's explicit use of homophobic slurs in a clearly insulting manner, coupled with its broad targeting of a specific group based on their sexual orientation, justifies its classification as hate speech.",21.81,[ 1.5602018  0.8424638 -0.820808  ... 11.157044   0.538038   2.9446526],0, offensive

- The tweet text contains the phrases ""ching"" and ""chong,"" which are mocking and derogatory terms used to imitate Asian languages or accents.
- These key features contribute to the classification by perpetuating harmful stereotypes and displaying contempt towards Asians, creating a hostile environment.
- The intended target of this hate speech is the Asian community, with the language used serving no purpose other than to demean and ridicule based on ethnicity.
- The tone and context reveal an intent to belittle and provoke offense under the guise of commenting on appearance (""cutie""), further cementing its status as hate speech.

1. Advocating for acts of terrorism and mass violence against civilians (blowing up buildings, a marathon, raping women, murdering queers in a club). 
2. Demonizing liberals/Democrats through association with these heinous acts.
3. Use of slurs and dehumanizing language to target homosexuals.

The intended targets are clear: homosexual men via the slur ""queers"", women (referred to as objects for rape), liberals/Democrats, and implicitly anyone who doesn't share the speaker's extreme views.

The tone is aggressive, hostile and menacing. The user incites violence while scapegoating already marginalized groups. This goes beyond mere offensiveness into explicit hate speech that aims to terrorize and dehumanize based on identity.

Although it mentions specific demographic groups (white girls) in the context of their dominance on a social media platform (TikTok), there's no use of explicitly derogatory or hate language that would qualify it as hate speech or even offensive.

The key point here is the absence of terms or phrases that directly insult, demean, or promote violence against the mentioned group. Instead, the user expresses curiosity about cultural trends on TikTok, which doesn't inherently carry a negative connotation.

- The intent seems to be societal critique rather than promoting animus towards an identifiable group.

Firstly, the term ""niggas"" is a highly derogatory and inflammatory racial slur targeting Black individuals. Its use in any context is considered hate speech due to its historical connotations and perpetuation of racist stereotypes.

Secondly, the repeated usage of the word ""bitches"" further reinforces the offensiveness of the text. This term is commonly used to degrade and demean women, reducing them to objects of disdain or ridicule.

The tweet's structure suggests an intent to belittle both the targeted racial group and women simultaneously. The phrase ""acting like bitches over some bitches"" implies that the individuals being referred to are behaving in an unreasonable or irrational manner, further perpetuating negative stereotypes.

Given the combination of a blatantly racist term and a misogynistic slur, the tweet is undeniably classified as offensive. Its language targets two specific demographics - Black individuals and women - in a demeaning and inflammatory way. The key features extracted from the text directly support this classification by highlighting the presence of highly charged and provocative language aimed at marginalized groups.

In conclusion, based on the use of extreme racial slurs and misogynistic terminology, coupled with the tweet's clear intent to demean and offend two specific demographics, the classification of ""offensive"" is fully justified. The language used in the text contributes significantly to a hostile and prejudiced environment, making its offensiveness unmistakable.",31.61,[ 2.3947616  2.6313505 -3.7047136 ...  4.2149305 -2.62098    3.3891344],2," offensive.

The user describes their appearance as ""sickening,"" which implies a strong negative reaction or disgust.

Despite the negative language used, this tweet doesn't contain elements of hate speech or direct offense towards a protected group. It lacks specific slurs or targeted insults based on race, ethnicity, religion, etc., which would categorize it as hate speech.

The term ""sickening"" could be seen as offensive in some contexts, but without more context about who Roseanne is and what prompted the comment, it's hard to determine if this rises to the level of an intentionally malicious or targeted attack. It reads more like a visceral personal reaction rather than a broader condemnation.

Given the ambiguity and lack of clear indicators of hate speech or direct offense, the ""normal"" classification seems most appropriate here. The tweet expresses an unflattering opinion in an imprecise way, but doesn't cross the line into the other categories based on the limited information provided.

The tweet contains a crude sexual assault allegation along with the term ""robbed"", which together convey an extremely negative and disturbing scenario. The reference to being ""raped and robbed by some charity"" trivializes serious crimes and could be deeply upsetting to survivors of sexual violence or those affected by criminal activity.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- The use of graphic terms like ""literally raped""
- Combining allegations of violent crime with the concept of a charity, which normally evokes positive sentiments. This juxtaposition is jarring and offensive.

While no specific group is targeted, the language used makes light of traumatic experiences in an offhand manner. The tweet's tone is very casual about portraying extreme violence and criminality.

- The target group is not specified, making it difficult to assess if this language was directed at a protected characteristic like race, religion etc.

In isolation and without further context, while the language used is clearly abusive and could be seen as bullying behavior, it lacks elements of targeted discrimination or promoting violence/hatred against a group based on protected characteristics that would categorize it as hate speech.

The tweet employs overtly racist language, specifically targeting individuals of African descent. The use of the term ""nigger"" is a clear marker of hate speech, and combined with phrases like ""polluting the royal blood line,"" it suggests a deep-seated bigotry.

Key features such as ""polluting"" and ""the royal blood line"" contribute to the classification by indicating a belief in racial purity and the degradation of this supposed purity by the presence or influence of African individuals.

- The tweet advocates for armed response (""are you being armed and are you shooting in the head when these zombies approach""). Encouraging lethal violence against a targeted ethnic group based on fabricated claims unequivocally categorizes this as hate speech.

   - Describing someone's appearance as ""roadkill"" further intensifies the insult by comparing it to something grotesque or disgusting.
   
3. Impact on Target Group: 
   - Women and homosexual individuals are directly targeted with demeaning language, contributing to a hostile environment for these groups.

4. Context and Tone:
   - The tone is aggressive and dismissive, using personal attacks instead of reasoned arguments, which indicates an intent to belittle or harm.

- The rant seems more driven by personal annoyance rather than broader animus.

The post comes across as crude and hostile in tone. However, without additional context about who ""<user>"" is or what content they posted, it's difficult to assess if this constitutes targeted harassment or credible threats.

Without clear context or additional indicators of hate speech, and no specific target group mentioned alongside the slur, it cannot be confidently classified as hate speech based solely on the provided information.

However, the use of a homophobic slur is inherently offensive, even if intended ironically. The tweet expresses frustration at not ""finding faggots"" while going out, which could perpetuate negative stereotypes about gay men or imply they are hard to find/meet in social settings. This contributes to a stigmatizing effect that is demeaning and belittling.

While the user's intent is unclear without more context, the tweet's casual use of an anti-gay slur in describing their social experiences makes it objectively offensive. It normalizes and trivializes the harm caused by such language when used seriously.

In conclusion, although not rising to the level of targeted hate speech, this tweet is classified as offensive due to its flippant use of a homophobic epithet, which contributes to a culture of denigration towards gay individuals even if intended humorously.

3. The overall tone of the tweet appears conversational without clear signs of malice or targeted insult, supporting its classification as neutral rather than hate speech or offensive.

4. Without explicit derogatory terms, threats, or hostile language directed at an individual or group, there's insufficient justification to categorize this as hate speech or even merely offensive content.

The tweet references sensitive topics like sexual assault and rape, associating them with a specific religious group (Islam) and a location (Nigeria).

Key Features:
- Mentioning the victims of sexual assault and their alleged assaulters.
- Associating these incidents with a religious school and Islam.
- Speculating about Nigeria's presence on a global list related to adult content consumption.

Impact on Target Groups: 
The text negatively impacts Islamic people by insinuating that sexual abuse is linked with their schools and religion. It also paints a negative picture of Nigerian individuals by connecting them to the watching of gay porn.

The tweet seems designed to stir controversy by linking serious crimes like sexual assault and rape with specific religious and ethnic groups, which may promote bigotry or hatred.

- Mention of different religious groups (Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs) accepting refugees.
- Emphasis on the idea that most countries do not discriminate when accepting refugees based on their religion.

1. The user expresses frustration about perceived double standards in public discourse but does not directly attack any group with slurs or promote violence/ supremacy.
   
2. Terms like ""racist"", ""nazi"", and ""illegal alien"" are quoted or referenced to make a point about free speech, rather than used as insults towards anyone.

Key points that support this classification:
- The tweet discusses a hypothetical situation involving a black girl falsely accusing white boys.
- It suggests that the motivation for such an accusation might stem from being ""taught to blame whites.""
- Despite touching on racially charged themes, it avoids overtly bigoted or aggressive language.

The text's impact and reference to target group:
- The tweet speculates about the motives behind alleged false accusations involving race. This could be interpreted as perpetuating a narrative that undermines legitimate claims of assault or harassment.
- It indirectly targets white individuals by implying they may be falsely blamed due to societal conditioning, which might foster resentment.

Considering the context and tone:
- The user seems to be engaging in a discussion about complex social issues rather than expressing outright animosity. 
- The phrasing is more speculative than accusatory, which mitigates its potential offensiveness.

Key factors that support a hate speech classification include:
- Sensitive real-world incidents being used to promote bigotry.
- Explicit targeting of specific individuals associated with those incidents.
- Racial comparisons drawn in an extremely negative light, promoting division.

The tweet's intent appears to be inciting racial tension by leveraging tragic events involving innocent victims. The mention of specific names and horrific crimes aims to dehumanize based on race.

It also attempts to argue in favor of accepting refugees from these countries regardless of their religious beliefs - a perspective that could be considered empathetic rather than hostile or inflammatory.

3. Misrepresentation and false equivalence: The text compares legitimate fears post-election to an unrelated act of violence, wrongly attributing collective blame to all Muslims and Clinton supporters.

4. Implicit accusation and divisiveness: By suggesting that gay voters who protested have 'forgotten' about the Orlando shooting, it accuses them of hypocrisy without basis. 

5. Intent to provoke: The tweet aims to stir up animosity by insinuating a link between Islamic extremism and liberal politics, disregarding facts.

1. The usage of the term ""kikes"" which is a derogatory slur against Jewish people.
2. The phrase ""filthy kikes"" indicates strong anti-Semitic sentiments.
3. Accusation that something has been ""kike infested"" suggests pervasive and negative influence attributed to Jewish individuals, reinforcing hate speech.
4. The text targets the Jewish community with hostile language and conspiracy theories about their control or corruption, which is a common trope in anti-Semitic rhetoric.

The key features such as ""filthy"", ""kikes"", ""infested"", and ""fraud"" are used to demean and spread hatred towards Jewish people.

The tweet targets women by utilizing a gendered slur, thereby promoting a negative stereotype and demeaning an entire group based on gender. The context suggests frustration or irritation, conveyed in an aggressive manner through the informal abbreviation ""atp"" (which stands for ""anyway, that's pointless""). This not only conveys a lack of respect but also implies a dismissive attitude towards the subject.

1. **Label Implication**: The classification of 'normal' suggests that the tweet does not contain any explicitly hateful or highly offensive content.
2. **Key Features**: The post doesn't seem to have any specific key features that would push it into the realms of hate speech or highly offense, aside from casual drug reference and mild profanity (""bitches""). 
3. **Target Group**: There isn't a clear target group in this tweet. It's a general self-expression with no direct or indirect reference to a specific community.
4. **Context & Tone**: The context seems to be someone sharing their current state (being high on Nyquil) in a somewhat joking manner. The tone is casual and informal, typical of social media banter.
5. **Conclusion**: Based on the lack of targeting or promoting harm towards any group or individual, absence of strongly inflammatory language, and the overall context of light-hearted self-deprecation, the classification of 'normal' is justified.

Key features supporting this classification:
- The usage of ""trailer trash"" directly targets and demeans a specific socioeconomic group.

1. **Normal Speech**:
   - tweet_text: ""<user> i think i followed because i am so concerned about queer theory gaining a foothold in schools we need lgb groups contributing to school policy we can not leave it to the homophobes or trans extremists""
   
This text expresses concern over the influence of queer theory in educational settings and advocates for the inclusion of LGB (lesbian, gay, bisexual) groups in shaping school policies. It raises a point about ensuring diverse perspectives are considered and not leaving decisions solely to those with extreme views.

Key points supporting the normal classification:
- The tweet doesn't use overtly hostile or bigoted language.
- It voices a viewpoint on an issue related to education and policy, without resorting to personal attacks or hate speech.
- While critical of ""homophobes"" and ""trans extremists"", it stops short of using dehumanizing slurs or advocating harm.

The text's tone is one of concern rather than incitement. It calls for greater involvement from LGB groups in policy discussions, reflecting a desire for balanced representation.

Explanation: The user's statement contains the term ""king kike,"" which is a derogatory slur against Jewish individuals, and uses it in relation to Donald Trump. This language sets a hostile tone towards the Jewish community and can be perceived as inciting hatred or hostility. Additionally, the user expresses their belief that Trump is not an ""anglo-Saxon white man"" and suggests that this is a dangerous characteristic. The user's statement could potentially incite racial or religious tensions, making it offensive.

However, it's important to note that the term ""dangerous"" used by the user does not necessarily indicate a threat of violence or harm towards individuals or groups. Instead, it could be interpreted as expressing a sense of concern or warning about potential negative consequences of Trump's actions or beliefs. This context should be considered when evaluating the overall intent and impact of the user's statement.

To summarize: The user's statement contains offensive language that targets Jewish individuals and could potentially incite racial or religious tensions, making it offensive. However, the user's intention may not necessarily be to incite harm or violence towards individuals or groups."

While it contains strong language and makes serious allegations, it does not cross the line into hate speech or direct offensiveness.

Key features supporting this classification:
- The use of ""kike"", which is a highly derogatory term for Jewish people.
- Accusation that the individual would disrespect Jesus in an extreme manner.

Despite these elements, the text falls short of being classified as hate speech because:
- It's focused on a single user's behavior rather than promoting hatred against a group. 
- The language used, while strong, serves to highlight perceived hypocrisy rather than incite violence or widespread bigotry.

This term is used in a context that accuses the targeted group of feigning ignorance about their role in supporting political movements, further exacerbating the offense by implying deceitfulness on top of the initial bigotry.

The user's intent appears to be inflammatory, aiming to provoke or insult rather than engage in meaningful dialogue. The tone is accusatory and hostile.

- Suggests they lack intelligence and are a burden on social services.
- Implies veterans are being unfairly overlooked in favor of refugees.
- Uses inflammatory terms like ""elite looters"" to criticize those seen as benefiting from the situation.

However, no direct threats or explicit hate speech are present. Its classification leans more towards neutrality due to this absence, though its undertones could be interpreted as subtly promoting prejudice.

The tweet accuses mainline Protestant denominations of being ""infiltrated"" and ""obsessed with muzzies [Muslims] and trannies [transgender people],"" implying a conspiracy theory where these groups pose a threat to Christian identity or doctrine. This conspiratorial framing amplifies the hate speech element by creating an us-versus-them dichotomy.

The tone of the text is hostile, characterized by a sense of urgency and warning about the supposed ""collapse"" of Christianity due to the influence of Muslims and transgender people. The language used suggests that these groups are not only different but also inherently dangerous or corrupting.

The tweet directly targets the African community by using this inflammatory language. The term is not only deeply offensive but also carries historical weight, evoking a legacy of slavery, segregation, and systemic racism.

In terms of tone and context, the phrase is concise yet potent in its animosity. It leaves little room for misinterpretation regarding the user's intent to offend and belittle. There is no contextual justification or nuance that could reframe this language as anything other than hate speech.

2. **Targeting a Group**: By specifically referring to ""white people"", the tweet targets a racial group and makes a generalizing statement about them which is inherently prejudiced.

3. **Derogatory Tone**: The language used carries a clear tone of disrespect and derision towards the targeted group, further cementing its classification as 'offensive'.

4. **Lack of Contextual Justification**: Without additional context that could potentially justify this language (e.g., quoting someone else or responding to specific behavior), it stands alone as an undiluted expression of prejudice.

The statement ""messrs morris white and bent for saying fuck all"" is vague and lacks context. Without clear targets or bigotry, it doesn't qualify as hate speech based on available information.

The context of a casual conversation about local takeaway shops further reinforces the normalcy of the discussion, with the slur appearing accidentally rather than being directed at any individual or group.

The text implies that being identified as queer is negative, suggesting an inherent prejudice against homosexuality. Moreover, the statement about not needing a second look reinforces this notion, indicating an immediate dismissal based on sexual orientation.

Despite the term ""compliment"" appearing, its use here is sarcastic and serves to exacerbate the insult by contrasting it with what would typically be considered flattering remarks.

Key Points:
- The author expresses an opinion on someone's guilt, seemingly in response to a news narrative.
- References a ""cnn narrative"" suggesting a media portrayal of events.
- Expresses sympathy for the affected family.

Analysis:
- This text lacks overtly hate speech or highly offensive content. 
- It criticizes a perceived media bias rather than attacking any group directly.
- While the language is informal and includes abbreviations, it doesn't cross into explicit offensiveness.
- The user expresses an opinion but does not use aggressive or targeted insults.

Conclusion:
Based on the absence of clear hate speech indicators, overtly hostile language, or direct targeting of protected groups, this tweet is best classified as normal. Its focus appears to be critiquing news narratives and expressing a view on guilt and punishment, without escalating into incitement or severe offensiveness that would warrant a different label.",22.64,"[ 0.38005674 -1.3180456  -6.7217627  ...  5.573752   -2.879539

Firstly, while the phrase ""a bitch"" is used, it's not directed at any specific individual or group. Without context, it cannot be definitively classified as hate speech or even overtly offensive.

Secondly, the metaphorical usage of ""catfish"" and ""salmon"" could imply a change in quality rather than referring to actual species. This suggests the comment might be about improving something (potentially oneself) rather than insulting any target group.

Finally, evaluating the context and tone, no clear malicious intent towards a specific demographic is evident. The user's intent seems more focused on expressing a desire for improvement or change, albeit using informal language.

The neutral label is justified as there's an absence of directed negativity, inflammatory language, or content that could reasonably cause harm or discomfort to others based on their race, ethnicity, religion, etc.

The user is expressing personal preferences for seasonal activities and attire associated with Halloween, which is a common cultural practice.

Key features:
- No usage of hate speech or slurs.
- The phrase ""this is my happy szn"" suggests positive emotion about the season.

Impact on target group: 
- The text playfully refers to a stereotype (""basic white bitch""), but does not promote negative stereotypes or harm any specific group. It's more of an inside joke than an attack.

Context and tone:
- The casual, humorous language indicates the user is sharing personal enthusiasm rather than attacking others.
- Terms like ""mind ya business"" underscore that this is a personal preference statement, not intended to provoke or insult.

Conclusion: 
The text's classification as normal is justified by its benign content, absence of hate speech or significant offensiveness, and overall light, self-deprecating tone.

The text does not contain any overtly hate speech or offensive language. It appears to be attempting to engage in a discussion about race relations and the experiences of different groups.

Key features that support this classification include:

1. The absence of explicit racism, slurs, or inflammatory language directed at any group.
2. The tweet seems to be presenting an argument or viewpoint on a social issue rather than inciting harm or promoting hatred.

The text's reference to ""a black person"" and ""a white person"" does touch on sensitive demographic identifiers but in a broader context discussing the shared human capacity for certain experiences, with the phrase ""we are all the same after all"" suggesting an appeal to universal equality. 

While the tweet could perhaps be seen as naive or oversimplifying complex issues of race and privilege, it does not cross into hate speech by endorsing supremacy or advocating violence/harm. Its tone seems more inquisitive than aggressive or inflammatory.

In conclusion, based on the absence of clear markers of hate speech or direct offensiveness, combined with what appears to be an attempt (albeit potentially clumsy) at a good-faith discussion on social dynamics and equality, the normal classification is justified here.

The tweet contains a colloquial and mildly aggressive phrase ""girl fuck you too"". However, the text is lacking in clear context or an explicitly identified target, which prevents it from being classified as hate speech or severely offensive. The inclusion of emojis adds a layer of ambiguity to the tone - they could be interpreted as either softening the harsh language or amplifying it.

The phrase itself is commonly used in casual and friendly banter among certain social groups. Without additional context, the tweet cannot be definitively categorized into a more severe classification such as hate speech or highly offensive content. The usage of ""girl"" could potentially imply gender targeting but lacks overt misogyny or sexism that would elevate it to those categories.

This term not only perpetuates negative stereotypes but also incites hatred and hostility towards the targeted group.

The key feature supporting this classification is the explicit usage of the word ""kike."" The context in which it's used, combined with accusations of sexual assault (""raped""), serves to further demean and vilify the target based on their ethnicity. This creates a hostile environment that promotes prejudice against Jewish individuals.

The tweet specifically targets the Jewish community through its use of language and references to alleged actions by Harvey Weinstein, a prominent Jewish American film producer convicted of sexual crimes. The context implies a sense of untouchability due to power and influence, further exacerbating negative sentiments towards this group. 

Considering the tone is accusatory and inflammatory, it's clear that the user's intent is to provoke anger or resentment rather than engage in any form of constructive dialogue.

The phrase ""zero niggers in donks blasting crap noise or beaners in pickup trucks blasting mariachi noises"" reveals a strong prejudice against these communities, expressing a desire for their absence and a disdain for their cultural expressions. The reference to ""it's great being white"" further emphasizes the superiority of one race over others.

The author seems to derive pleasure from the absence of people of color in their vicinity, which is a clear indication of deep-seated bigotry. This sentiment is reinforced by the contrast between the peaceful day described and the disruptive presence ascribed to African and Hispanic individuals.

- Key features such as ""little"" and ""bitch"" are used together to belittle someone, typically a woman, thus making it an explicitly gender-targeted insult.

- Though there is no specific group targeted, women in general are indirectly referred to in a negative light. This type of language can perpetuate misogynistic attitudes by normalizing the degradation of women through insults and threats.

The target is not explicitly specified but seems to be a user who has been temporarily banned from a site called ""pew tube"". The tone implies the speaker finds this amusing rather than something to criticize or attack.

**Offensive Analysis:**

1. **Label Implication:** The label ""offensive"" indicates that the text contains language or ideas that may cause offense or hurt to a specific group or individual.
   
2. **Key Features Justification:** While there are no explicitly listed key features, the tweet itself targets two groups - Caucasian and Homosexual individuals - by suggesting they should change their behavior. This implies a negative generalization about these groups, which is a common characteristic of offensive speech.

3. **Target Group Impact:** The tweet is directed at ""white queer people,"" making it clear that the intended target group includes both Caucasians and members of the LGBTQ+ community. By telling this group to ""stop being like that,"" the text negatively stereotypes and potentially offends these individuals.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment:** The tone of the message comes across as critical and dismissive, indicating a negative intent towards the target groups. This further supports the classification of the tweet as offensive.

5. **Conclusion Justification:** Given the direct targeting of specific demographic groups in a negative light and the dismissive tone, this tweet is classified as ""offensive.""

Key features like 'slut' and 'shaming' are deployed in a context that degrades women, specifically the speaker's own mother.

The reference to the mother being ""raped as a teenager"" further intensifies the offensiveness, as it trivializes a serious crime and employs it for public shaming. The term ""slut shaming"" is intrinsically gendered and targets the morality and sexuality of women in a reductive way.

Furthermore, the tone is hostile and aggressive, evidenced by phrases like ""the fuck not"". This conveys an intent to demean and insult, rather than engage in any constructive dialogue.

1. The tweet, while using explicit terms like 'fucking' and 'queer', does not appear to be promoting hate or marginalizing any group.
2. Key features that might have suggested a different classification include the harsh language and discussion of queerbaiting. However, these alone do not necessarily constitute hate speech or offensiveness if they're used in a critique rather than an attack.
3. The target groups mentioned are 'Homosexual' and 'None', indicating no direct targeting of any specific group.
4. Considering the context and tone, it seems more like an impassioned criticism of perceived queerbaiting by Halsey than an outright attack on any identity group.

3. There is no direct attack or use of explicitly derogatory language towards any specific group.

However, it does contain some elements that could potentially be considered controversial:
- The phrase ""stop wasting your time crying"" could be seen as dismissive or insensitive to the refugee crisis.
- Mentioning refugees in relation to citizenship and political manifestos might suggest a politicized view of the issue. 

But overall, given the lack of directly abusive language or targeted hate speech, and considering it's discussing a political topic, this text is best classified as normal rather than hate speech or even offensive.

3. While critical of Democratic politicians' priorities, the language is more opinionated than blatantly offensive.

This analysis suggests the text falls into the ""normal"" category. Its political criticism doesn't employ obviously inflammatory slurs that would warrant an ""offensive"" classification. However, some may argue its premise unfairly maligns Democrats as indifferent to sexual violence and trafficking until it was politically advantageous to care.

The classification of this text as hate speech is justified by the presence of the deeply offensive term ""nigger"" which is used here to degrade Georgia Tech based on its supposed connection to the African American community.

Key features such as ""look more chinese,"" ""bitch,"" and ""dumbass"" are crucial in this classification:

1. The phrase ""look more chinese"" propagates stereotypes about Asian appearances.
2. ""Bitch"" is a gendered slur that demeans women by reducing them to aggressive or unpleasant traits.
3. ""Dumbass"" offensively targets individuals with disabilities, suggesting lower intelligence.

The combination of these terms creates a hostile environment and promotes bigotry against the mentioned groups. Although presented as personal opinions about an individual, the choice of language extends beyond the individual to target broader groups based on ethnicity, gender, and perceived intelligence.

In conclusion, this text is classified as ""offensive"" because it contains multiple slurs and stereotypes that target Asian individuals, women, and those with disabilities, contributing to a negative and demeaning environment.",24.45,"[ 3.996126   -0.88813466 -0.2788317  ...  4.6049957  -4.181066

- Though the tweet discusses sensitive topics like race and the background of a political figure, it does not employ overtly racist or hate-filled language. It argues about the perceived racism against Caucasians in Obama's case, which is a subjective viewpoint rather than a direct attack.
  
- The tone is informal and uses emojis at the end, suggesting a light-hearted or sarcastic intent rather than serious malice.

1. The tweet does not contain explicit hate speech or direct attacks against any group.

3. Phrases like ""you are all literally immigrants"" and ""come on"" indicate a tone of exasperation rather than outright hostility.

The tweet's main thrust is to point out an inconsistency in the stated views of some white Australians regarding immigration, which is a topic of public discourse. It does not employ slurs or advocate harm against any group.

Here's an analysis based on the provided framework:

1. Label Implication: The classification of ""offensive"" suggests that the language used in the tweet is aggressive and insulting, targeting a specific individual or group.

2. Key Features: Although no key features are explicitly mentioned, the usage of strong expletives such as ""dumb fucking bitch"" directly contributes to the offensive nature of this text. 

3. Target Group Impact: The target seems to be women in general, but more specifically, it appears to address an individual named Carson. The language used is highly demeaning and carries a tone of hostility.

4. Context and Tone Assessment: While the tweet ends with ""i hate you,"" preceded by a request for a hug, this juxtaposition doesn't soften the overall aggressive and insulting tone. It's likely that the conflicting sentiments are meant to convey a sarcastic or insincere hug request, amplifying the insult rather than lessening it.

5. Conclusion: Despite the seemingly contradictory emotions expressed, the use of severe profanity and direct insults towards an individual categorizes this text as ""offensive"". The intent appears to be hostile and insulting, disregarding any mitigating context that might suggest a playful or affectionate intent.

The tweet expresses a strong dislike for Valve, a video game company. However, it does not contain elements of hate speech or targeted offense towards any specific group or individual.

Key points:
- The use of profanity intensifies the sentiment but is directed at a corporation, not a demographic.
- Lacking specific slurs or language intended to degrade, the tweet falls short of being classified as hate speech.
- Though the language may be seen as harsh, it's within the range of typical expressions of dissatisfaction in casual online discourse.

3. While the text mentions different demographic groups, it does so in a positive and inclusive manner without singling out any group for negative treatment or stereotypes.

4. The tone of the message is neutral to slightly positive, advocating for unity and shared humanity rather than division or bigotry.

Labeling this text as 'normal' appears to be incorrect. A more appropriate classification would be either 'hate speech' or 'offensive', based on the following analysis:

1. Implication of Hate Speech/Offensive Label:
The text contains xenophobic and conspiratorial language targeting Islamists, globalists, and Europeans. It suggests a global conspiracy by ""globalists"" to instigate civil war through the use of ""Islamist"" people against white populations in Europe and India.

2. Support from Key Features:
While no explicit key features are provided, the text includes terms like ""globalist"", ""civil war"", ""Islamists ppl in europe against white n india"". These phrases suggest a conspiracy theory involving race and religion, which is characteristic of hate speech or offensive language.

3. Impact on Target Group:
The tweet targets Arab and unspecified groups by suggesting they are pawns in a globalist plot to incite civil war. It creates an ""us vs them"" mentality between the mentioned ethnic/religious groups and others.

4. Context and Tone:
The context of the tweet is highly charged, with accusatory language creating a hostile tone towards the supposed conspirators and their alleged puppets. This inflammatory rhetoric intends to insight fear or animosity.

Conclusion:
Given the conspiracy theories, xenophobic overtones, and targeted groups, this tweet's classification as 'normal' seems inaccurate. The more appropriate label would be either 'hate speech' for its promotion of violence or conflict based on race/religion, or 'offensive' for the use of inflammatory language targeting specific ethnic/religious groups.

The tweet employs extremely vulgar language with the phrase ""getting ass raped"" which is highly graphic and sexually violent.

1. Label Implication:
   - The text is classified as hate speech due to its usage of extremely derogatory and inflammatory language aimed at a specific ethnic group.

2. Key Features Support:
   - Terms like ""nigger"" and ""typical nigger shit"" are explicitly racist and degrading, reinforcing negative stereotypes and fostering an environment of bigotry.
   
3. Impact on Target Group:
   - African Americans are directly targeted with the most vile slurs, indicating a clear intent to demean and provoke anger or distress within this community.

4. Context and Tone Assessment:
   - The contrast between ""crazy person"" and ""sane person"" suggests that holding bigoted views against African Americans is rational or justified, further amplifying the hate-filled message.

5. Conclusion Justification:
   - This text unequivocally falls under hate speech due to its use of egregious slurs, promotion of baseless stereotypes, targeting of a specific ethnic group with vile language, and tone that suggests bigotry is sane or reasonable.",25.38,"[ 0.10073667 -2.119764    0.32828608 ...  7.9366026  -0.86796683

1. The tweet discusses a sensitive political issue regarding forced pregnancies and reproductive rights, but does not employ language that could be directly classified as hate speech or overtly offensive.

3. There is no direct incitement of violence or advocacy of hateful ideas against any target. The critique focuses on policy and power structures, not inherent qualities of a group.

4. Despite the serious tone and provocative topic, the post remains within bounds of political discourse without crossing into abusive language or clear-cut hate propaganda.

The tweet text contains language that is hostile towards a religious group. Key points include the repeated use of ""moslem,"" a clear misspelling intended to mock and denigrate Muslims. It also suggests that individuals within this group are inherently associated with terrorism (""potential terrorists"") and do not belong in the UK, reinforcing a message of exclusion and vilification.

The target of this hate speech is clearly identified as Arab, Islam, indicating the intent is to foster animosity or cultural intolerance towards these groups. The phrase ""moslems do not belong here"" directly echoes sentiments of xenophobia and religious bigotry, justifying its classification as hate speech.

- References to slavery imply that the user endorses this brutal practice, further highlighting their hostility towards African Americans.

The tweet targets the African American community through the usage of the term ""niggers"" and the reference to slavery. It suggests that had slavery continued, it would have led to the creation of ""super niggers"", which is both dehumanizing and demeaning.

This explicit call for purging is coupled with positive sentiment (""was glorious""), reinforcing the violent animosity.

The reference to ""the russians buying that"" adds an additional layer, implying foreign influence or interference related to this act of purging. The term ""russian bot narrative"" further suggests a conspiracy theory surrounding these events and aims to cast doubt on legitimate online activity by associating it with orchestrated deception linked to a foreign power.

The user's intent appears to be promoting division and fostering animosity towards the mentioned demographic, employing provocative language for this purpose.

- The inclusion of ""fuck"" intensifies the tweet's aggressive tone, which may be interpreted as promoting an antagonistic stance towards those who oppose the user's views.

The usage of the word ""niggas"" is a strong indicator of hate speech. Despite the lack of specified key features and target information, this term alone is enough to categorize this text as hate speech due to its deeply derogatory and inflammatory nature.

The classification into normal is incorrect given the presence of such explicit and hostile language. The tweet's intent seems to be to denigrate a group based on their race, which aligns with characteristics of hate speech. Therefore, the appropriate label should be ""hate speech"" based on the usage of the extremely pejorative term that demeans an entire community.

Key features supporting this classification:
- The usage of ""bitch"" in a dismissive and hostile context directly contributes to the tweet's offensiveness.
  
Impact on the target group:
- Women are targeted by the use of this term, which can perpetuate negative stereotypes and contribute to a hostile environment online.

Context and tone assessment:
- The overall tone is aggressive and dismissive, indicating an intent to belittle or insult.

The classification as **Offensive** is justified due to the inclusion of overtly insulting language directed towards women.

The phrase ""common sense"" preceding it does not mitigate its offensiveness but rather implies that controlling African Americans is a reasonable or rational action, exacerbating its hatefulness.

The tweet clearly targets individuals of African descent, promoting bigotry and hostility against them based on their race. By proposing the need for ""control,"" it creates an us-versus-them mentality, encouraging division and prejudice.

2. Encouraging violence against these groups by suggesting they should be met with rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons. This promotes an aggressive approach towards the targeted communities.

- ""Ugly bitch"" is a misogynistic insult that demeans women. 
- Referencing the target's ancestors as having ""simian"" (ape-like) traits left in them perpetuates racist tropes of dehumanization.

The text specifically targets an individual African woman, using language that compares her and her ancestry to primates. This not only expresses hate but also promotes a hierarchy of races by insinuating a relation to lower species.

However, without clear context or more inflammatory language directly attacking a group based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc., this text falls into the normal category. It expresses an opinion on immigration policy, though harshly worded, without rising to the level of prohibited speech.

Key features like referring to someone as ""the illegal alien in the white house"" and saying they should be deported are important for understanding the tone and viewpoint but don't make it hate speech by themselves.

3. The reference to a ""muzzie"" could be perceived as potentially problematic, but without additional context, it's unclear whether this term is being used in a pejorative manner.

4. The overall tone of the text seems light-hearted and non-aggressive, focusing on an individual's achievement rather than their identity or characteristics.

While it mentions derogatory terms such as ""spic"" and ""beaner,"" which are slurs targeting Hispanic individuals, the context suggests a personal conversation addressing hurtful language within a relationship or friendship dynamic.

The key features supporting this classification include:
1. The acknowledgment of being called slurs by another person (""azzmador"") but expressing particular hurt when it comes from the specific individual they're conversing with.
2. An apology for their own behavior and excessive messaging, indicating remorse and a desire to reconcile.
3. No direct usage of slurs or explicit hate speech against any group.

The impact on or reference to the targeted Hispanic group is indirect and situated within a personal context. The user doesn't endorse the slurs but rather expresses discomfort when used by someone they have a connection with, indicating an understanding of the terms' offensiveness.

Considering the context and tone, it seems the user's intent is to communicate personal feelings about being referred to using derogatory language by someone close to them. This suggests the conversation's nature revolves around personal relationships rather than promoting or condoning hate speech.

Firstly, it doesn't contain explicit hate speech or direct targeting of a group with derogatory language. Although it discusses sensitive issues around homosexuality and parenting choices, it does so in a generalized way without personal attacks.

Key features that support this classification include the lack of inflammatory language or specific targets. The text argues a viewpoint but stops short of vilifying those who may hold opposing views. It advocates for acceptance but doesn't condemn individuals who may struggle with that.

The tone is firm and direct yet doesn't cross into overt hostility or aggression towards any person or group. While some may find the sentiments controversial, it remains an opinion presented without clear hate speech indicators.

- This text contains derogatory language targeting the LGBTQ+ community, implying that having queer children is undesirable and using derogatory terms like ""queer"" and ""homophobia."" It also expresses a hostile attitude towards individuals who do not accept or approve of queer people.
- The text promotes intolerance and discrimination, which are core elements of hate speech. The use of exclamation marks to emphasize the derogatory language further amplifies the harm and hostility conveyed in the message.
- Given the explicit expression of hatred towards a marginalized community and the use of derogatory language, this text is classified as hate speech."

However, there is no direct hate speech or explicitly offensive content present. The mention of a ""gay little frog"" could be seen as slightly whimsical or bizarre rather than maliciously intended.

Given that gefilte fish is indeed a traditional Jewish dish and the tweet seems to comment on its origin in a fantastical manner without expressing any animosity, the classification of this text as normal is reasonable. The key phrase ""gay little frog"" doesn't seem to be used in a pejorative way or aimed at demeaning homosexuals. 

The overall nonsensical nature of the statement and lack of clear malice or targeted offense towards any group supports its neutral categorization.

- Key Features Analysis: The use of the word ""niggers"" is a crucial feature. This term is a highly offensive and derogatory slur targeting African people. Its inclusion suggests that the tweet should be classified as hate speech rather than normal due to its explicit racial bigotry.
- Target Group Impact: The text directly targets individuals of African descent, employing one of the most severe racial slurs in an ostensibly nostalgic manner. This creates a hostile environment for the target group and perpetuates historical prejudices.
- Context and Tone Assessment: The nostalgic tone (""i miss"") coupled with the use of a slur indicates a longing for times when such language was more acceptable. This suggests that the user's intent may not be to promote violence but rather to express a warped sense of nostalgia or humor, which still makes it hate speech.
- Conclusion: Despite being labeled as normal, this tweet clearly falls into the category of hate speech due to its use of an extreme racial slur and its targeting of African individuals. The context and tone serve to reinforce the offensiveness of the language used, making it unfit for a neutral classification.",26.73,[-1.2847288 -2.2033007  3.3218865 ...  9.818499  -4.1534476  2.7636642],1," hate speech.

Although no specific individual or group is targeted, the generalized reference to ""lady"" extends this hostility to all women, making it a clear case of gender-based hate speech.

The context implies an intent to harm or threaten, using extreme language to demean and invalidate the target's worth. This tweet is not just an isolated incident but part of a larger pattern where such language can normalize violence against women.

The key feature that influences this classification is the use of the word ""niggas"" which is a variation of a highly controversial and historically oppressive term targeting individuals of African descent. This term's presence in the tweet, regardless of context, carries strong negative connotations and can be deeply offensive to many readers.

The text also seems to reference drug culture with the phrase ""bless the trap"", further adding an element of controversy. The mention of ""the man with the white"" may allude to cocaine use, which is a sensitive topic that could offend some audiences due to its associations with addiction and criminality.

However, the tweet does not directly incite violence or express hatred towards any specific group, nor does it use direct slurs against protected characteristics like race or ethnicity. This prevents the classification from escalating into hate speech. 

In conclusion, while this text may have elements of humor or colloquial slang to some readers, its use of a controversial racial term and references to drug culture make it likely to be seen as offensive by many.

The term ""whores"" adds another layer of misogyny to the already hostile message.

The text also presents a false narrative about roles in Western pop culture, asserting that white actors are always depicted as villains and black individuals as promiscuous. This baseless claim promotes stereotypes and stokes unwarranted resentment towards the targeted groups.

Explanation: The text's use of racial slurs targeting African Americans, combined with derogatory stereotypes, clearly demonstrates an intent to incite hatred and contempt towards this group. Additionally, the phrase ""western pop culture is devolving into niggerdom"" employs the 'n-word' as a pejorative term, suggesting that black individuals are inferior or problematic elements in society. These statements create a hostile environment that undermines racial equality and fosters an atmosphere of intolerance and prejudice.

To further support this conclusion, let us compare it to the context provided:

Text 1: ""i live in a white neighborhood and i nigger it tf up"" (hate speech)
Explanation: This statement contains an explicit racial slur targeted at African Americans with a hostile intent.

Text 2: ""white people say they have dark humour and then just call you a nigger and laugh it off bc they have black friends"" (normal)
Explanation: The context of this text is one of critique, highlighting the problematic behavior of some individuals using humor to mask their prejudiced language.

Text 3: ""of course there will always be white actors and actresses it just they are slated to always play villains and nigger whores western pop culture is devolving into niggerdom at such frightening pace it truly is painful to watch"" (hate speech)
Explanation: The text's usage of the 'n-word' in a derogatory context, along with racist stereotypes, demonstrates an intent to incite hatred and contempt towards African Americans. These statements contribute to a hostile environment that undermines racial equality and fosters intolerance.

In conclusion, all three texts share common themes of racial prejudice but differ in their intentions: one is a personal expression of hate (hate speech), while the other critiques societal behavior (normal). It is essential to differentiate between these contexts to foster an environment that values inclusivity and respect."

- The phrase ""trailer trash"" is a pejorative term that denigrates individuals based on their perceived low socioeconomic status. It implies that the person being referred to is of lesser value or morality due to living in a trailer home, which is often associated with poverty and uneducated backgrounds.
- This tweet is classified as offensive because it employs a term that demeans an entire group of people. The language used targets those from lower income brackets, reinforcing negative stereotypes and contributing to class-based prejudice.
- Although no specific individual or group is directly mentioned, the phrase ""trailer trash"" carries broader implications for any person living in trailer homes or perceived as being part of this socioeconomic class.

The tweet accuses Juan Williams of manipulating people's minds for political gain, labeling him as part of a 'commie' (communist) partnership. This accusation is wrapped in intensely hostile language and personal attacks, which contributes to its classification as hate speech.

Moreover, the context reveals an attempt to discredit and demean the target based on race and perceived political affiliation. The tweet's intent appears to provoke anger or hostility towards Juan Williams by using incendiary slurs that have historical ties to oppression and violence against African Americans.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- The use of the word ""wetback"" in reference to visa applicants.
- The suggestion that the GOP should ""play hardball"" regarding immigration policies, implying a hostile stance against Hispanic refugees or immigrants.

The tweet's tone is aggressive and dismissive towards the targeted group. The user appears to be advocating for stricter immigration policies and expressing disdain for those applying for visas, particularly Hispanics. This context emphasizes the offensiveness of the language used.

The text presents a perspective on religious beliefs, specifically Islam and atheism. It advocates for worshipping the Creator alone as being logical and natural, which is a fundamental tenet of Islam.

Key points:
- The message does not contain any explicit hate speech or direct offense towards any group.
- It discusses theological concepts in a straightforward manner without employing aggressive or inflammatory language.
  
Given these factors, the text can be classified as neutral. It expresses a religious viewpoint without targeting or demeaning others who may hold different beliefs. While it promotes a specific interpretation of worship, it does so in a non-confrontational way that is characteristic of open dialogue rather than hate speech or intentional offensiveness.

1. The tweet does not contain explicit hate speech or derogatory language targeting any group.
2. It mentions ""deflection"", suggesting a discussion about diverting attention rather than promoting hate.
3. The text refers to being called a ""white supremacist"" for raising certain issues, but does not specify what those issues are.

Though the term ""white supremacist"" is referenced, it appears in a meta context of discussing how others might falsely apply this label. No specific group or individual is targeted by hate speech.

In conclusion, despite touching on sensitive topics, the tweet itself avoids engaging in hate speech or direct offense against any group. Its focus on debating tactics rather than attacking individuals aligns with a neutral classification.

Conclusion: The tweet is classified as neutral because it criticizes a political figure without using clearly abusive or targeted speech that would qualify as hate or offense.",22.5,"[ 3.083062    0.12419939  0.04498612 ...  4.6733084  -4.455122

While it mentions a potentially sensitive topic regarding the Jewish identity of Wikipedia's founders, it does so in a neutral context without promoting hate or offense.

The user acknowledges checking the claim about Wikipedia and maintains a peaceful tone despite referencing an intentionally provocative question from others who have targeted them with antisemitic slurs (""kike""). Their statement ""be peaceful"" emphasizes their desire to avoid conflict. Additionally, they express affection for puppies, adding a light-hearted touch which further supports its classification as normal.

Despite the presence of an ethnic slur, it's presented not in an attacking manner but quoted from aggressors and coupled with a clear preference for peace and positivity. The context shows no intent to incite hate or harm any group.

- The tweet uses the term ""hoe,"" which is a slang term often used to demean women, particularly in reference to their sexual behavior. This contributes to its classification as offensive content.

- The phrase ""you can not make a hoe a housewife"" suggests that certain women (referred to as ""hoes"") are inherently unsuitable for the role of a housewife, perpetuating negative stereotypes about women's worth and roles in society.

- By targeting women with this language, it contributes to an environment where misogyny is normalized. The tweet's content trivializes the harm caused by such misogynistic language and attitudes.

In conclusion, this tweet is classified as ""offensive"" due to its use of a specific derogatory term aimed at demeaning women and perpetuating negative stereotypes about their roles in society.",18.65,[ 1.3689728  5.637803   1.8773371 ...  4.3754973 -4.640716   2.0428236],2," offensive.

Key features:
- The term ""attention whore"" is a misogynistic slur that demeans women by equating them with promiscuous behavior for seeking attention.
- ""Moslem"", a misspelling of Muslim, and the reference to a ""moslem run un"" spreads Islamophobic sentiments.

The text targets two groups: women, through the use of a gendered slur; and Muslims, by misrepresenting their religion and implying malicious intent. This combination of misogynistic and Islamophobic language creates a hostile environment that promotes hate against these groups.

Furthermore, the tweet suggests that certain individuals will ""kill canadians"" to achieve their goals. This not only incites violence but also falsely accuses a targeted group of being willing to harm others for personal gain.

1. The label's implication suggests that while the topic may be sensitive or mature, the presentation lacks direct hate speech or overt offensiveness.

2. Key features in this context refer to the discussion of a fictional scenario involving underage marriage and implied sexual assault within the ""Game of Thrones"" series. While these themes are indeed serious and potentially disturbing, they do not alone constitute hate speech or explicit offensiveness in the context of a fictional narrative discussion.

3. The text does not appear to target any specific group maliciously or spread direct harm. It acknowledges that the character is a fictional construct and that the author's portrayal does not equate to real-world endorsement or actions.

4. Contextually, this seems to be part of a broader discussion about the distinction between fictional representation and reality. The user appears to defend the author by emphasizing the difference between fictional characters and real people.

The term ""niggers"" is a well-known and severe racial slur against African individuals, while ""honky,"" though less common, is similarly intended to offend Caucasians perceived as sympathetic towards civil rights or affirmative action. The inclusion of additional accusatory terms like ""thieving"" and ""racist"" amplifies the hostile sentiment.

- The target of this hate speech is clearly the Jewish community, with the use of ""kike"" being a blatant act of anti-Semitism.
- The tone is aggressive and mocking, evidenced by the laughter emoji and the phrase ""lmfao,"" which conveys a lack of empathy and an intent to cause harm.

- The tweet text: ""i amma slut her up though lol"" contains the key feature ""slut,"" which is a pejorative term often used to demean and objectify women based on their perceived sexual behavior or appearance. 
- This usage targets women, reducing them to mere objects of ridicule or desire, thus promoting a culture of misogyny.
- The casual tone indicated by ""lol"" does not diminish the offensiveness; it normalizes the use of such derogatory language against women.
- Consequently, this tweet is classified as offensive due to its explicit degradation and objectification of women through the use of a highly gendered slur.

The phrase ""i hate you all"" expresses a clear sentiment of hostility and animosity towards an unspecified group or individuals. This aligns more closely with the definition of hate speech, which involves language that denigrates or expresses hatred towards a target group.

Key features supporting this reclassification:
- The direct expression of hatred with the phrase ""i hate you all"". 
- The absence of context to justify this sentiment as sarcasm or irony.
- The broad and undefined nature of the target (""you all"") which amplifies the potential harm.

Key features:
- The usage of informal language and slang such as ""lowkey"" and ""nigga"", which could be seen as casual or colloquial rather than explicitly derogatory.
- The phrase ""ain't that nigga if he ain't simpin on a song"" critiques Drake's authenticity based on whether he includes songs that show devotion to a degree some may consider excessive or subservient (simping).

While the language is informal and critical, it does not promote violence, attack a protected group, or incite hatred. The tweet seems more focused on critiquing an artist's work rather than targeting any group based on race, ethnicity, gender etc.

The tone is casual and conversational rather than hostile or aggressive. It uses slang that may be seen as neutral or even endearing within certain communities.

Overall, despite the informal phrasing, this tweet falls under normal speech due to its focus on critiquing artistry rather than attacking identity. The language, while potentially crude, does not cross into hate speech or direct offensiveness based on protected characteristics.

The tweet employs several key features that contribute to its classification as hate speech. The usage of the term ""nigger"" is a clear indicator of racial bigotry, targeting African or minority groups with a deeply offensive slur. Coupled with this, phrases like ""monkeys are the problem"", ""go back to Africa"", and ""catch AIDS"" further amplify the hate-filled message.

These elements work together to create an overtly hostile environment, not only demeaning the target group through dehumanizing language (""monkeys""), but also suggesting they are a ""problem"" that needs resolution. The directive to ""go back to Africa"" espouses a xenophobic sentiment, implying that individuals of African descent do not belong in other regions. Moreover, the reference to AIDS adds an additional layer of bigotry, exploiting a disease associated with stigma and fear for the purpose of insult.

The tone is aggressive and demeaning, leaving no doubt as to the user's intent to offend and belittle the targeted group. The use of ""cunt"" at the end further intensifies the hostility and personal attack.

Considering the target as ""Asian"" and given that no blatantly hate speech terms are used, this leans more towards an ambiguous or non-hostile utterance in isolation. Without clear indicators of malice or a pattern of such behavior from the user(s), it's prudent to classify this as normal social media interaction pending further context.

In summary, while ""ching chong ching"" could be perceived as insensitive mimicry, the absence of overt bigotry and lack of identifiable key features supporting hate speech or offense leads to its classification as normal.

The key features - 'boomer', 'toughguy', and 'sheboon' are instrumental in this categorization. The word ""boomer"" is often used negatively online to criticize older individuals, the term ""toughguy"" mocks perceived machismo, while ""sheboon"" is an outright slur against women of African descent.

Moreover, the tweet targets both elderly men and women, particularly those from Africa. By describing a scenario where an older man goes out of his way to use obsequious language towards the woman, it perpetuates negative stereotypes about both groups.

1. The text does not contain any explicit hate speech or highly offensive language.
2. It appears to be a response to a previous conversation where the user is clarifying their earlier statement about the term 'queen'.

4. The context implies a playful or sarcastic tone rather than malicious intent.

The tweet contains overtly hostile and defamatory language targeting Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore. Key features include:

- The phrase ""chinaman satanist"" which employs an ethnic slur (""chinaman"") combined with a religious insult (""satanist""). This constitutes hate speech by demeaning someone based on race and religion.
  
- Accusations like ""lee hsien loong criminals"", suggesting criminal activity, and ""disloyal to his criminals and lawyers"". Baseless claims of criminal behavior aim to damage reputation.

- Mention of ""audible talks"" and ""wellington circle singapore"", possibly alluding to secretive conversations or networks. This adds a conspiratorial tone.

Key features such as ""nigger,"" ""jew,"" and ""muslim"" are used in a blatantly pejorative manner, revealing a strong intent to demean and insult the mentioned communities. The tweet also questions the British identity of individuals residing in a place referred to with an extreme profanity (""cunt of a place""), further emphasizing its xenophobic and bigoted nature.

The use of the word ""nigger"" specifically targets individuals of African descent, aligning with the designated target group. This term is notorious for its historical association with slavery and segregation, evoking deep-seated hatred and marginalization.

Additionally, the inclusion of terms like ""jew"" and ""muslim"" demonstrates a broad-brush approach to perpetuating religious prejudice. The tweet not only attacks these communities but also conflates their identities in a hostile manner.

The context of the text is one of aggressive exclusion and intolerance, with the user asserting that individuals belonging to certain ethnic or religious groups are inherently un-British if they reside in a particular location deemed undesirable. This further underscores the classification as hate speech due to its inflammatory language and divisiveness.

The term ""plastic"" suggests artificiality or insincerity, while ""hoes"" is a slang term that reduces women to sexual objects. This language not only demeans the target group but also perpetuates negative stereotypes about women's authenticity and value.

The user's intent appears to be dismissive and derisive of the targeted demographic, seeking personal gain (""get rich"") without regard for their dignity or worth. The tone is casual yet hostile, indicative of a lackadaisical attitude towards causing offense.

In conclusion, this text falls into the ""offensive"" category due to its usage of explicitly demeaning language aimed at women, coupled with an overall derisory and dismissive tone.

- There are no evident contextual cues that could mitigate or justify the use of such an inflammatory term.

- They note that a friend of the person they're discussing is Muslim, and uses pejorative terms for both Islam (""alah ackabar"") and Muslims (""moslem"").
- The term ""liberal moslem antfia"" suggests disapproval or criticism.

Explanation: The text contains derogatory language towards specific ethnic groups, including ""beaners"" and ""daca recipients.""

It also makes generalized statements about crimes committed by a specific group, which can be harmful and misleading.

Additionally, the text mentions ""white children"" and ""hordes,"" which could potentially be interpreted as inciting fear or division based on race. However, without further context it is unclear if this was the intention of the author. Overall, while not explicitly hate speech, the text still contains offensive language that could be harmful to certain communities.

It's important to remember that even if a text is not technically hate speech, it can still contribute to a toxic and divisive online environment by promoting intolerance and prejudice towards specific groups of people.

The tweet contains several key features that suggest it should be categorized as hate speech:

1. The label's implication for the text is significant. Classifying this text as normal underplays its inflammatory and prejudiced content.
   
2. Key features supporting a hate speech classification:
   - The accusation of forced evacuation, massacre, and rape leveled against Kashmiri Muslims. These are severe allegations that promote animosity based on religion and region.
   - The language used is aggressive and provocative, with phrases like ""sole culprit"" assigning complete blame to one group.

3. The target group, Kashmiri Muslims, are clearly referenced in a negative light. This can incite hatred or hostility towards them.

4. The context and tone aim to vilify Kashmiri Muslims by accusing them of heinous acts without providing evidence, indicating an intent to spread hate.

The combination of the term's explicit hostility and its direct reference to the Jewish community leaves no ambiguity about its classification. It contributes to an environment of intolerance and bigotry by casually incorporating a term of hate into online discourse. The lighthearted prefix ""lol"" does not mitigate the severity of using a recognized slur but rather compounds the offense by implying that the use is without consequence, further normalizing hate speech in casual conversation.

In conclusion, the classification of this text as hate speech is unequivocally supported by its use of an unambiguous ethnic slur and its targeting of the Jewish community.",23.35,[ 0.6903832  3.335643   4.0778646 ... 10.366415  -4.6208935  1.401018 ],0," offensive. The term ""kike"" is a derogatory slur against Jews, and using it in a laughing manner can still be considered offensive, even if not explicitly hateful. However, it's important to note that the context and intent of the user should also be taken into consideration when determining if the comment crosses the line into hate speech. In this case, the text is only ""offensive"" based on the given input alone."

Despite mentioning historical figures associated with the civil rights movement and alluding to sensitive topics like homosexuality, it does not directly vilify or attack any particular group.

Key features supporting this classification include the absence of explicit hate speech or aggressive targeting. While references to Malcolm X, white supremacy, and Rosa Parks could potentially evoke strong reactions, they are presented more in a context of personal opinion and historical interpretation rather than direct bigotry.

The mention of turning lesbian feels speculative rather than an intentional slur against homosexuality. And labeling someone as following ""white supremacy"" without further context doesn't clearly cross the line into hate speech.

Overall, despite touching on charged topics, the text lacks the clear derision or demonization of a protected group that would warrant an offensive or hate speech classification. The intent seems more to criticize perceived hypocrisy or ideological inconsistency by the individuals mentioned.

In summary, while the tweet contains references to sensitive social issues and historical figures, it stops short of directly attacking any group in a manner that would classify it as overtly hateful or bigoted speech.

Explanation: The text implies that Rosa Parks, an iconic civil rights activist, would become a lesbian instead of being with a ""failing man,"" and the use of the term ""strong black man"" in reference to someone who follows white supremacy is derogatory and offensive. While it does not directly target or mention any particular group with hate speech, it contains offensive language and stereotypical assumptions."

The tweet uses the term ""dyke"" which is a homophobic slur against lesbians. Additionally, it employs strong language like ""bitch slapped"" and accuses leftist judges of ignoring the Constitution and having disregard for the law, using the phrase ""perversity."" This combination of targeted slur and extreme language could be very upsetting to members of the LGBTQ+ community and those who support equal rights.

However, the tweet does not appear to directly target or threaten any specific individuals. The primary focus seems to be expressing frustration with recent court rulings and perceived political bias among judges. There is no call to violence or suggestion of physical harm based on sexual orientation.

In conclusion, while the language used could certainly be considered crude and potentially offensive to some, the overall message seems more politically motivated rather than driven by anti-LGBTQ animus alone. The tweet falls in a grey area - the homophobic slur pushes it towards hate speech, but the broader political context keeps it from being clearly classified as such.

The term ""bitch"" is directed at women and carries a deeply negative connotation, undermining respect and civility towards the target individual.

The text's intent appears to express contempt or dislike for a specific person from a marginalized group (""white bitch""), reinforcing stereotypes and encouraging animosity. It creates a hostile environment by using inflammatory language that can exacerbate social tensions.

The tweet employs the term ""bitches"" and ""bitch,"" which are derogatory slurs targeting women. The usage of such language, especially in a possessive manner (""thats my girl""), perpetuates misogyny and objectification of women.

This classification is based on:
1. The presence of explicit, gender-specific slurs.
2. The hostile tone and aggressive claim over a woman, reinforcing the offense.
3. No contextual justification for such language, affirming its offensiveness.

3. The tweet seems to critique double standards among viewers regarding representation in media based on race - suggesting that if a show like 'The Proud Family' had white characters, there would be outrage.
4. While the language is informal and may be seen as provocative, it does not directly promote hatred or attack any group. Instead, it highlights perceived hypocrisy around racial issues.
5. In conclusion, despite using potentially loaded language, this tweet seems more focused on social commentary than outright bigotry or offense towards a particular target.

1. **Label Implication**: The classification of hate speech implies that the content promotes or encourages animosity towards a specific group or individual based on attributes such as race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.

   - ""shitskin"": This term is an ethnic slur directed at individuals with dark skin, particularly those of Indian descent.

Explanation: The text contains derogatory language towards certain groups, using terms like ""cucks,"" ""shitskin,"" and ""borthers,"" which can be considered hate speech or discriminatory language. Additionally, the use of the term ""faggot"" is homophobic and offensive. However, it's important to note that the context in which these words are used may influence their meaning and intent. In this case, based on the provided text alone, it appears that the user is using derogatory language as a form of insult or attack towards others.

Related examples: The first example provided is not comparable, as it contains graphic and disturbing content that goes beyond hate speech or offensive language. The second example, while containing strong language, was determined to be normal because it expressed individual frustration and did not target any specific group with hate or offense.

In this case, the text uses derogatory language towards multiple groups, and the context does not appear to suggest a self-focused expression of personal frustration or emotion. Rather, it seems intended as an attack or insult towards others based on their race, sexuality, and political beliefs.

Therefore, the use of such language is considered offensive, even if some individuals may use it as a form of casual insult or banter. It's important to remember that using derogatory language can be harmful and hurtful to those who are targeted, and it's always best to avoid using such language altogether."

The use of terms like ""muzzies"" - a disparaging slur for Muslims, coupled with accusations of condoning invertebrate tendencies and operating Jihad recruitment groups, underscore a clear intent to vilify and spread animosity towards this religious group.

Key features such as ""invertebrate tendency"", which insinuates a lack of moral backbone or cowardice among Muslims, along with the reference to CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) as ""the nest of vipers"", further reinforce the text's hate-filled rhetoric. The author employs these incendiary phrases to paint an us-versus-them narrative that encourages fear and hostility against the target.

Moreover, by questioning the civil rights being protected and linking those efforts directly to violent extremism via Jihad public relations recruitment groups, the text actively undermines Muslim advocacy organizations. It casts suspicion on their motives and insinuates a covert malevolent agenda - thereby inciting animosity towards both CAIR specifically and the broader Islamic community.

1. **Label Implication**: The label ""hate speech"" suggests that the text contains language or ideas intended to demean, harass, or incite violence against a specific group based on their race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.

2. **Key Features Justification**:
   - ""trash ass niggers"": This phrase includes a strongly derogatory term (""niggers"") targeted at African individuals, indicating a clear intent to degrade and offend based on race. The accompanying words intensify the insult.

3. **Impact on Target Group**: 
   - The text directly targets people of African descent with an abusive slur, promoting a hostile environment that can incite further prejudice or violence against this group.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**:
   - The aggressive tone and the use of explicit language indicate a deliberate attempt to offend and belittle the target group, reinforcing the hate speech classification.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The tweet's usage of extreme racial slurs and hostile language aimed at individuals based on their African heritage justifies its classification as hate speech.

Despite containing a derogatory term (""faggot""), it lacks clear indicators of direct targeting or malicious intent towards any specific individual or group. 

Key Features:
- The use of the slur ""faggot"" could be perceived as potentially offensive, but without additional context, it's challenging to determine if this constitutes hate speech.

Target: 
- The text doesn't explicitly target a group or individual, making it difficult to assess intent or impact.

Tone and Context:
- The mention of ""other songs on this playlist"" suggests the user might be quoting or referring to lyrics, rather than expressing personal views. This context mitigates the potential offensiveness.

Conclusion: 
Given the ambiguity around intent and the lack of a clear target, the text is classified as normal.

4. The context implies a dismissive or demeaning attitude towards the subject matter, further supporting the classification as it lacks any form of constructive dialogue or respect.

The user seems to be responding to another's statement about linking something (unspecified) with wanting to kill undocumented immigrants. They express confusion and disbelief that such a connection was made.

Key features supporting this classification:
- No direct slurs or dehumanizing language.
- Questioning the rationale of linking something to violence against immigrants suggests disagreement or incredulity rather than endorsement.
- Mentioning ""black friends"" in possession of guns indicates diversity in friendships and challenges the notion that only white people own firearms.

While alluding to a sensitive political topic involving undocumented immigration, the text itself doesn't promote violence or use inflammatory language. Instead, it questions the logic of an argument made elsewhere.

The key feature in this text is the term ""hoe"", which is a derogatory slang for women, often implying promiscuity. This language choice is explicitly degrading and misogynistic, targeting women in a negative light.

While no specific individual or group is directly targeted (target = None), the tweet's generalization and demeaning tone towards women are clear indicators of its offense. The use of violent language (""kick"") in conjunction with the slur further amplifies the hostility.

Considering the context and overall tone, it seems that the user intends to express disdain or anger towards a woman or women in general through aggressive and insulting terminology.

These terms are used in a demeaning and hostile manner, illustrating a clear intent to offend and perpetuate prejudice.

The text goes beyond mere offensiveness by constructing a narrative that denies the agency and dignity of the targeted groups. The assertion that ""nobody wants to touch nigger hair not even other niggers"" dehumanizes African individuals by suggesting they are universally undesirable and disrespected, even within their own community.

Additionally, the phrase ""kike spawned muh magical negroes horse shit"" employs anti-Semitic language while also trivializing and mocking the struggles of African Americans through the dismissive term ""muh magical negroes.""

3. **Target Group Impact**: The text references both Caucasian and Asian ethnicities in the context of social behavior (fetishizing and seeking clout).

These slurs are directed at specific marginalized communities, revealing a clear intent to demean and spread animosity towards these groups.

The text suggests that areas with Jewish populations will inevitably suffer due to the presence of these diverse groups. It further claims that Jews ""easily brainwash most whites into hating themselves,"" perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes of manipulation and control. This conspiratorial language is a hallmark of hate speech, aiming to stoke resentment against the targeted group.

2. It also includes highly inflammatory language such as ""traitorous pig,"" ""filthy kike first bitch,"" and advocating for violence against Israel with ""nuke Israhell now."" These statements are not only deeply offensive but also incite violence, which is a hallmark of hate speech.

3. The tweet targets multiple groups including Caucasians, Jewish people, women (""first bitch""), and potentially others who support Trump or Israel. This multi-faceted attack broadens the scope of hatred being espoused.

4. The context suggests that the author is accusing Trump of betraying his country by allegedly supporting genocide and ""grovelling"" (a misspelled term likely intended as 'groveling') for Israel, further stoking anti-Semitic tropes about loyalty and control.

- The term ""nigga"" is used casually, which could be seen as problematic but doesn't inherently suggest hate speech in this context.
- There's no clear target of hate or offense mentioned. 
- The tweet seems to express confusion and mild annoyance rather than malice or aggression.

Impact on Target Group:
- While the language might offend some readers, it isn't explicitly used to demean any individual or group based on race, ethnicity, religion, etc.
- It appears to be recounting a personal interaction without broader generalizations or stereotypes.

Context & Tone Evaluation:
- The user seems to be sharing a personal anecdote about an interaction with someone that left them puzzled and irritated.
- There's no apparent intent to promote hatred or harm any community. 

Conclusion:
The casual use of potentially controversial language doesn't align with the thresholds for hate speech or even offensiveness in this context.

- The usage of ""nigger"" directly targets individuals of African descent, perpetuating a long-standing history of racism and oppression.
  
The target group is explicitly identified as ""African,"" with the slur used in direct reference to this demographic. This showcases the user's intent to offend and degrade based on race.

The context and tone of the text suggest a defensive stance, using hate speech to assert a false sense of superiority based on skin color. This not only demonstrates the user's ignorance but also their malicious intent to harm and insult.

Key points:
- The tweet discusses systemic issues of race in American politics and society.
- It highlights a sentiment of disillusionment and fear among African Americans.
- While critical, it aims to provoke thought on social issues rather than promote hatred.

The tweet text ""would anyone actually expect a nigger to save a white man life"" employs the term ""nigger,"" which is an egregious racial slur used against African Americans. This word has historically been utilized to demean and undermine the dignity of black individuals, evoking a legacy of oppression and violence.

Key features such as ""a"", ""nigger"", ""to"", ""save"" in the context of questioning whether anyone would anticipate a black person to save a white individual's life contribute significantly to its classification as hate speech. The term ""nigger"" alone carries substantial weight, but combined with the scenario painted—challenging the notion that a black person could or should save a white person's life—it reinforces a prejudiced and dehumanizing view of African Americans.

The tweet clearly targets African Americans by questioning their capacity and willingness to perform an act of heroism for a white person. This not only propagates negative stereotypes but also incites division and animosity based on race.

In conclusion, the use of highly inflammatory language combined with the tweet's racially charged implication justifies its classification as hate speech.

The use of ""burn in hell"" is also a threat and indicates a desire for harm. This language is intended to demean and incite hatred towards these groups."

The key feature influencing this classification is the use of the term 'bitch', which is a highly derogatory and misogynistic slur targeting women. This word carries strong negative connotations and is often used to demean or insult females in a harsh manner.

Despite no specific individual being targeted, the generalized nature of the statement implies a broad, negative characterization of women. The inclusion of religious language (""god"") further intensifies the offense by invoking divine judgment or displeasure against the subject.

In conclusion, the text's use of explicit gendered slurs and its dismissive tone towards women justify its classification as offensive. It contributes to an environment that trivializes misogynistic language and perpetuates negative stereotypes about women.",16.88,"[ 0.28166938  7.1522      3.0670035  ... 15.031624   -4.2300177

Here's the analysis:

1. The label 'normal' implies that the text does not contain elements of hate speech or overt offensiveness.
2. While the tweet mentions negative comments made on another person's Instagram page, it doesn't reproduce these comments directly.
3. It refers to a personal dispute rather than targeting specific groups based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc., which is typical for hate speech or highly offensive content.
4. The context appears to be interpersonal drama instead of systemic bigotry or aggression.
5. Despite the reference to unpleasant behavior, the text itself doesn't employ explicit slurs or promote violence/hatred.

In conclusion, although the described situation involves unpleasant remarks, the tweet reporting it is informational and devoid of direct hate speech or extreme offensiveness.

Explanation: The user's comments are racist, misogynistic, and offensive towards the woman in question. The use of derogatory terms like ""trailer trash"" and ""ew he ugly"" is demeaning and intended to belittle her based on her race and appearance. The comments about her having ""no melanin"" and being ""white"" are racist and rooted in a prejudiced belief system that values certain physical features over others. Overall, the user's comments aim to offend and demean the targeted woman, making it hate speech."

1. The language used in the tweet includes slurs and insulting terms such as ""retarded,"" ""faggot,"" and ""gay."" These words are aimed at demeaning individuals based on their mental capacity and sexual orientation, respectively.

2. Key features that support this classification include:
   - ""Retarded"": A term used to insult someone's intelligence in a derogatory manner.
   - ""Faggot"": A homophobic slur used to target and degrade homosexual individuals.
   - ""Numpty"" and ""Gay"": Both terms are used pejoratively here, with ""numpty"" suggesting stupidity and ""gay"" being employed as an insult.

3. The tweet targets the homosexual community by using the word ""faggot,"" a term that is deeply offensive to many within this group. It also uses ableist language (""retarded"") which can offend or harm people with disabilities.

4. The tone of the user's message appears aggressive and hostile, indicating an intent to insult or provoke emotional distress in the recipient.

Here's a concise analysis:

1. The label ""normal"" suggests that the content does not contain overtly hateful or offensive language.

2. While the tweet references ""white ass cheeks,"" without additional context, it seems to be more of an off-color, personal preference rather than a targeted insult or slur against any group. 

3. There is no clear target being attacked or marginalized based on the limited information provided.

4. The tone seems playful and irreverent rather than hostile or aggressive. It appears to express a personal opinion in a casual manner.

5. In conclusion, while mildly crude, the tweet lacks the key features of hate speech (slurs, calls to violence, overt bigotry) or clear intent to offend a specific group. Its classification as ""normal"" seems reasonable based on this analysis, although some may find the language distasteful. More context would help assess tone and intent more definitively.",22.63,[ 3.378515  -1.5777605  5.5681944 ...  8.346154  -2.2787278 -1.3585683],1, normal

However, based on the provided information, it is challenging to definitively classify this statement into hate speech, offensive, or normal categories due to missing context. The term ""incels"" refers to involuntary celibates, an online subculture known for expressing frustration and hostility towards society, particularly women. Mentioning that this tweet inspired such a group to commit violence suggests the original content could potentially promote harm.

The reference to being called ""cuban pete"" and claiming to be ""the king of the rumba"" injects an element of confusion into the text. These phrases appear to be playful or nonsensical, which contrasts with the serious claim about inspiring violence.

Despite these elements, without additional context, it's difficult to assert this text is definitively hate speech or even overtly offensive. It lacks direct discriminatory language or personal attacks typically found in such content. However, its reference to violent incitement and seemingly nonsensical self-proclaimed titles does render it unusual and potentially concerning.

In conclusion, while there are indicators of potential harm, the scarcity of context precludes a definitive classification into hate speech or offensive categories based solely on this snippet. The text includes elements that could be seen as references to violence and an online subculture associated with such ideologies, yet it also contains playful language which complicates straightforward analysis.

- Key features such as ""towel head"" are used to mock traditional clothing and thus stereotype a cultural group, while ""ass hoed"" is vulgar slang further intensifying the insult.
- This language carries strong negative connotations and aims to demean based on race and gender, aligning with hate speech.
- The tone is openly hostile, revealing the intent to offend, marginalize, or incite violence against the targeted groups.

Key features:
- The mention of ""white 9"" and ""j and nikes"" suggests a discussion about clothing or shoe brands, but the connection is unclear due to the informal language used.
- No clear target group is identified in the text.
- The statement seems more focused on personal disappointment rather than targeting any particular community.

The classification of this text as normal is primarily because it lacks elements that would categorize it as hate speech or overtly offensive. There's no evidence of intentional harm or aggression towards a specific demographic.

1. Label Implication: The classification of ""normal"" suggests that while the text expresses a strong opinion against certain practices, it does not cross into hate speech or overtly offensive language.

2. Key Features Supporting Normal Classification:
   - No direct slurs or highly inflammatory language.
   - Focus on opposing political/ideological concepts like Sharia law and sanctuary cities rather than attacking people directly.
  
3. Impact on Target Group: 
   - Criticism of Islamic religious and legal practices could be seen as targeting the Muslim community.
   - However, the main thrust is against specific concepts, not a broad attack on all Muslims.

4. Context and Tone Assessment:
   - The tone is firm and uncompromising in its stance against certain ideas.
   - It stops short of dehumanizing language or direct calls to violence/hatred, keeping it from hate speech territory.

5. Conclusion Justifying Normal Classification: 
   - While the text expresses an intolerant viewpoint, it does so by criticizing political/religious concepts rather than attacking a group using slurs or dehumanization.
   - It walks up to, but does not cross, the line into overtly bigoted hate speech.
   - The normal classification acknowledges the problematic nature of the views expressed, while recognizing they are articulated in a way that avoids being openly inflammatory or inciting hatred.",31.14,"[ 2.9078827   4.0753546   0.17233393 ...  4.4915466  -1.7541711

The user employs aggressive language like ""oh shit,"" ""fuck,"" and ""plz explain this"" which further exacerbates the hostility. The reference to ""shilling blank slate"" suggests an accusation of hypocrisy or deceit, adding another layer of attack. 

By directing these slurs at a specific individual (<user>), the text not only spreads hate but also encourages others to target this person based on their perceived associations or beliefs.

The language used is harsh and the sentiment is highly critical.

Key points that support this classification:

- The reference to the Republican party as a ""clown car"" full of ""white nationalists"" and ""conspiracy crackpots"" uses metaphorical and blunt language to convey disdain.
- The claim that these individuals are ""easily exploited by Fox News"" and other interests suggests manipulation and lack of independent thought or morality.
- The tweet predicts an extreme outcome: billionaires aiming to become ""trillionaires"" while the rest of society becomes ""slaves,"" illustrating a sense of deep concern or alarm about societal inequity.

However, despite the strong language and negative characterization, this text does not appear to incite violence or use slurs directed at specific individuals or protected groups. It falls into the realm of protected political speech, even if it is seen as extreme by some.

This term is used in conjunction with aggressive language and violence, expressing a desire for physical harm against an Asian political figure referred to pejoratively as the ""fat little gook rocket man"". The key feature that supports this classification is the word ""gook"", which is a known slur for people of East Asian descent.

The intent behind using such language seems to be to dehumanize, insult, and provoke violence against both the individual mentioned and Asians more broadly. The tone is aggressive and inflammatory, employing hyperbolic violence (""beat the fucking shit out of"") to underscore the animosity towards the target group. 

In conclusion, this text's classification as hate speech is justified by its use of a severe ethnic slur in an explicitly hostile context that advocates for real-world violence against an Asian person and by extension, the broader community.

The term ""moslem,"" a clear misspelling of ""muslim,"" coupled with ""barbarians,"" serves to dehumanize and vilify all members of the Islamic faith. This aligns with the definition of hate speech, which involves attacking or demeaning a group based on characteristics such as religion.

Moreover, the tweet's call for ""revolution"" and ""war"" adds an incendiary element, suggesting violent action against the targeted religious group due to their perceived threat. The solution proposed is extreme and absolutist, with no room for dialogue or peaceful resolution.

The context and tone underscore a sense of urgency and hostility, painting a picture of an existential conflict where drastic measures are needed. This further reinforces the classification of hate speech as it seeks to rally others against a common enemy based on prejudice and fearmongering.

- The tweet text contains the highly offensive and derogatory term ""nigger"" directed at an individual wearing a Trump hat. This term is a clear marker of hate speech, as it targets and degrades African individuals based on their race.

- The key feature supporting this classification is the usage of the slur ""nigger"". This word has historically been used to demean and oppress African Americans and carries with it a heavy weight of racism and bigotry.

- The tweet specifically targets an individual who is likely African American, indicated by the use of the racial slur. By associating this person with being a right-wing social justice warrior (SJW), the user is not only employing a racist term but also suggesting that the target's political views are invalid or hypocritical due to their race.

- The tone and context suggest an aggressive intent from the user, seeking to belittle and insult the target based on both their race and perceived political alignment. 

In conclusion, the use of a severe racial slur in conjunction with political insults justifies the classification of this text as hate speech. It demonstrates clear prejudice and hostility towards the targeted individual based solely on their race and supposed political leanings.",26.52,"[ 1.064943    0.83274925  0.49547234 ...  4.1161733  -4.7939916

**Neutral Classification Justification**:

1. **Intent Analysis**: The tweet seems to be seeking information or clarification about the roles and influence of specific individuals associated with right-wing politics. It does not express hate or offense toward any group.
   
2. **Language Tone**: While it mentions politically charged terms such as ""trump nazi whisperer"" and ""right wing christian white anglo saxon nations,"" these are used within a context of inquiry rather than expression of bigotry or malice.

3. **Target Group Reference**: Although it references political ideologies, there's no direct attack on any ethnic or social group. The focus is on understanding the roles of certain individuals in promoting those ideologies.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**: The tweet lacks clear indicators of hate speech or intentional offensiveness. It reads more like a request for information, lacking inflammatory language that would suggest malicious intent.

Here's a concise analysis:

1. The label ""offensive"" implies that the content is likely to cause offense or distress to some readers due to its controversial and sensitive subject matter.

2. Key features supporting this classification:
   - Advocating for autocracy (rule by a single person with absolute power) in exchange for strict control over certain social groups.
   - Suggesting that homelessness should be criminalized, implying those experiencing it are criminals.
   - Proposing tight immigration control, which could stoke anti-immigrant sentiment.
   - Endorsing imprisonment of LGBT individuals simply based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
   - Threatening women not to report sexual violence, potentially promoting a culture of silence around this issue.

3. The tweet targets vulnerable groups like the homeless, immigrants, LGBT people, and survivors of sexual violence, advocating for punitive measures against them in exchange for perceived stability under an autocratic regime. 

4. While presented as ""respectful disagreement"", the underlying message condones human rights violations and marginalization of certain communities.

5. In conclusion, despite its seemingly polite tone, this tweet promotes authoritarianism and discriminates against multiple groups by suggesting they should be controlled or punished to maintain order. Its content is likely to cause significant offense and distress, especially among those directly targeted.",31.6,[-4.919274   8.361341  -2.3004143 ...  8.959251  -1.5319653  3.958976 ],1, offensive

The key features include the terms ""southern redneck racist,"" which stereotype a specific group, and ""blacks,"" used in a context that implies segregation or preference based on race.

Though the user attempts to balance the statement by saying this individual is a ""good guy"" who works with African Americans without issue, the overall message still promotes an environment of intolerance. The tweet's target audience appears to be both Caucasian and African American users, discussing the personal prejudices of an acquaintance.

The context suggests that the user may have been attempting to provide nuance to a complex individual; however, the tone is casual about racism, which contributes to its classification as ""Offensive."" The use of informal language and lack of condemnation imply acceptance or normalization of these views.

In conclusion, this tweet's classification as ""Offensive"" is justified by its perpetuation of stereotypes and its casual treatment of prejudiced attitudes towards African Americans. Though it may not rise to the level of hate speech, it remains a text that can promote an unhealthy dialogue on race relations.",26.16,"[-1.3222865  -0.08005224 -0.18118116 ... 12.08238     1.6252187

It criticizes this viewpoint and the broader context of U.S. policy decisions.

Key Points:
1. The author takes issue with the U.S. categorization of Middle Eastern people, arguing it's incorrect.
2. They also reference ""repeated dumb shit,"" suggesting dissatisfaction with various actions or policies from the U.S.
3. The phrase ""trust the state"" is used sarcastically to underline skepticism toward government decisions.

Classification Justification:
- While critical of U.S. policy, the text lacks explicitly abusive language or direct attacks on a group or individual, preventing an ""offensive"" classification.
- It doesn't incite violence or promote supremacy ideologies, ruling out ""hate speech.""
- The neutral label is supported by its focus on debating government classifications and policies rather than attacking individuals.

1. The label's implication: The term ""offensive"" suggests that the language or content of the text has the potential to insult, demean, or upset a specific group or individual.

2. Key features supporting classification:
   - Usage of explicit and crude language: Words like ""shake,"" ""ass,"" ""bitches,"" ""studs,"" and ""dykes"" are coarse and sexually charged terms.
   - Targeting based on sexual orientation and gender: The tweet specifically references ""dykes"" (a slang term for lesbians) and uses the term ""studs"" in a way that implies a judgmental stance about how people should behave within their sexual identity.

3. Impact on or reference to target group:
   - The text suggests that the speaker has opinions about what is appropriate behavior for ""bitches,"" ""studs,"" and ""dykes."" This kind of stereotyping can be deeply insulting, as it reduces individuals to mere caricatures based on their sexuality or gender identity.

4. Context and tone assessment:
   - The informal and colloquial tone of the tweet may suggest a casual setting, but the language used is aggressive and confrontational. The phrase ""you can not pay me to"" suggests defiance and resistance against pressure from others, further highlighting an underlying tension or conflict.

5. Conclusion justifying classification:
   - The use of explicit and derogatory terms such as ""bitches,"" ""studs,"" and ""dykes,"" coupled with the implication that these groups should conform to certain behaviors, creates a hostile tone that could be considered demeaning and insulting to the referenced communities.

Key features include the mention of ""unemployed moslems,"" implying laziness or unwillingness to work, and advocating for deportation, which reveals an underlying xenophobia.

The impact on the target groups (Islam and potentially non-Islamic countries) is significant as it promotes stereotypes and hostile sentiments towards these communities. The tone of the text is blatantly aggressive and intolerant, indicating a clear intent to demean and provoke resentment against the specified religious group.

- **Label Implication**: The classification indicates the presence of language that may cause offense or distress, particularly to specific groups.
  
- **Key Features Justification**: The usage of terms like 'faggot' and 'ass' in a negative context supports this classification. These words are considered explicit slurs directed at homosexuals and serve to demean.

- **Target Impact**: The target group here is the homosexual community. The tweet employs a known homophobic slur, directly targeting and offending this group.

- **Context & Tone Evaluation**: The tone of the text appears dismissive and derisive, further solidifying its classification as offensive. The context suggests an attack on the credibility or intelligence of those associated with NASA who believe in CGI explanations for certain events.

- **Conclusion**: This tweet is classified as ""offensive"" primarily due to its use of explicit homophobic slurs aimed at demeaning a specific group within the context of a dismissive and insulting remark.

Explanation: The user's statement contains derogatory language towards individuals associated with the NASA community and the LGBTQ+ community.

1. The label 'Normal' implies that while the text discusses a sensitive topic, it does so without using overtly hateful or abusive language.

2. Key features: The tweet acknowledges and criticizes the presence of transphobia within the black community. It also contextualizes this issue by connecting it to white supremacy. This complex analysis contributes to its classification as 'Normal', as opposed to hate speech or purely offensive content.

3. Target group: The text addresses both the black community and the broader societal context of white supremacy. By doing so, it opens a dialogue about internalized prejudice without attacking any specific individuals or groups.

4. Context and tone: The tweet is written in a critical yet thoughtful manner. It does not resort to inflammatory language or personal attacks but instead presents an argument that invites reflection on intersecting forms of oppression.

1. The label's implication: The text does not contain explicitly hateful or overtly offensive language targeting a specific group or individual. While it expresses criticism and disapproval towards a person in power, this alone doesn't categorize it as hate speech or necessarily offensive.

2. Key features supporting the classification: The absence of key slurs, abusive terms, or inflammatory language that would indicate hate speech or offensiveness is notable. The tweet criticizes the individual's understanding and past actions related to sexual harassment but does so without employing clearly derogatory or discriminatory phrases.

3. Impact on or reference to target group: There is no specific demographic or social group targeted by this text. The criticism is directed towards a single person based on their perceived actions and statements, not their identity or membership in any particular community.

4. Context and tone assessment: While the tone is critical and disapproving, it does not cross into clear incitement to hatred or violence against an individual or group. It challenges the individual's qualifications and understanding of an issue but doesn't employ dehumanizing language or direct threats, which are often indicative of hate speech.

5. Conclusion justifying classification: Based on the lack of overtly abusive language, specific targeting of vulnerable groups, and a tone that primarily expresses disagreement rather than inciting harm, the text is best classified as ""normal.""

Additionally, the text attempts to deny the shooter's whiteness by noting their Jewish and Hispanic heritage. This further contributes to its classification by promoting a false equivalence between these identities and justifying bigotry towards them.

1. The label 'normal' suggests the text doesn't contain overtly aggressive or bigoted content.

3. Target: The reference to ""angry white man"" and ""nazi"" targets Caucasians, particularly those stereotyped as aggressive or extremist.
4. Context and tone: The casual, joking tone (""lmao"") trivializes the serious historical and cultural connotations of comparing someone to a Nazi.
5. Conclusion: Despite its normal classification, the text draws on potentially offensive stereotypes. However, it lacks clear malice or direct abuse, keeping it from being classified as hate speech or overtly offensive.

The mention of ""nazi"" in association with a specific ethnic group could be seen as inflammatory, but without more context about the original user's intent or the conversation's nature, the classification leans towards normal.

1. The label 'normal' implies that the text does not contain hate speech or explicitly offensive content.

   - The text does not appear to directly target any particular group negatively.

   - The context is a statement about someone named Jonghyun being supported in their creative pursuits, specifically writing a song with a theme related to sexual orientation. The tone seems neutral or potentially positive due to the mention of support.

1. The presence of explicit, inflammatory language intended to demean and insult based on ethnicity.
2. The tweet's reference to Farrakhan and Pompeo, suggesting that associating with certain individuals is somehow acceptable due to perceived liberal double standards. This introduces a political angle that exacerbates the already hostile tone.

The use of such derogatory terms in a public forum can contribute to an environment of hostility and intimidation for members of the targeted community. The intent appears to be provocation and the promotion of prejudiced views.

The key feature, ""beaner"", is central to understanding why this text promotes hate speech. It perpetuates negative stereotypes and creates an environment where it's acceptable to target and demean Hispanic individuals based on their supposed interests and cultural practices.

Moreover, the tweet specifically targets a Hispanic audience, suggesting that the intent was not just to express personal preference or engage in lighthearted humor but to insult and degrade members of this community.

- The tweet uses highly inflammatory and derogatory terms such as ""cheater,"" ""newfag,"" ""bloated,"" and especially ""kike,"" which is an extremely pejorative term for a Jewish person.
  
- Key features like ""kike"" and ""identification"" indicate the user's intent to single out and attack individuals based on their religious identity. The combination of these terms with accusations of deceit (""cheater"") amplifies the hostility.

The classification is justified as follows:

1. The label's implication: Offense through the use of targeted, demeaning terminology.
2. Key features support: The phrase ""this person is retarded"" employs an ableist slur that demeans individuals with intellectual disabilities. Its usage here targets a specific group in a negative context.
3. Impact on target: By using 'retarded', the text mocks and devalues people with cognitive disabilities, perpetuating harm and stigma against them.
4. Context and tone: Invoking God to emphasize the author's claim about someone's supposed mental state adds gravity to an already insulting statement. The casual usage of a serious condition trivializes its impact.

3. Target Group Impact: The reference to ""repubs"" (presumably, Republicans) could be seen as politically charged but does not cross the line into direct insult or attack based solely on this text.
4. Context and Tone Assessment: Given the lack of explicitly hostile language or direct personal attacks, the political commentary appears more aligned with general dissatisfaction rather than promoting hate or offense.

- The tweet text contains a highly derogatory term targeting individuals of African descent. The use of the word ""niggers"" in conjunction with an implied negative action (""spray with insecticide"") unequivocally classifies this as hate speech.
- The key feature supporting this classification is the explicit slur, which is intended to demean and dehumanize the targeted group.
- By employing such language in a metaphorical context suggesting extermination, the user's intent appears to promote hostility or violence towards African individuals, amplifying its hate speech categorization.
- Additionally, the tone is aggressive and belittling, further indicating the user's animosity towards the target group.

1. The label 'neutral' indicates that the content doesn't contain explicit hate speech or overtly offensive language.
2. While there are no key features specified, the text advocates for solidarity among women and encourages listening to marginalized voices within the community.
3. Although the tweet touches on sensitive topics like oppression and violence faced by trans individuals, it does so in a supportive context. It calls for unity and understanding rather than promoting negativity or hostility towards any group.
4. The tone is direct but not aggressive. It encourages empathy and awareness without resorting to inflammatory language.

1. The tweet is a question asking about the process by which certain groups reclaim and repurpose derogatory terms.
2. It does not use the terms in a pejorative or aggressive manner but rather inquires about the phenomenon of linguistic reclamation.
3. While it references sensitive terms, it does so within an academic or intellectual context to understand sociolinguistic processes.

The key features supporting this classification are:
- The interrogative nature of the tweet (asking ""how"" versus making a statement)
- The focus on understanding and education rather than insult or provocation
- The lack of direct targeting or malice towards any group

Though the terms mentioned could be considered highly offensive in different contexts, here they're used to discuss the sociolinguistic concept of reclamation. This neutralizes their impact, as the user seems to be engaging in an exploration of language evolution within societies.

Key features that support this classification include:

- The absence of direct slurs or blatantly prejudiced terminology.
- A general tone that, while potentially controversial in its preference, does not cross into explicit hate or aggression toward any group.
  
The text's reference to a ""white christian 1 9 5 0"" could be seen as promoting a specific religious and ethnic identity. However, without additional context or direct attacks on other groups, it doesn't constitute hate speech.

The intent behind using such language appears to be antagonistic or mocking in nature, creating an environment of hostility. 

Key Features: 
- The term ""niggers"" is a strong contributing factor, signifying the hate speech label due to its historical use as a means of denigrating and subjugating people based on race.

Impact on Target Group:
- The tweet's employment of this ethnic slur directly targets individuals of African and Jewish descent. It carries connotations of inferiority and contempt, fostering an atmosphere conducive to prejudice and bigotry.

Context and Tone:
- The context implies a suggestion for scheduling, but it is overshadowed by the inflammatory slur used at the end which detracts from any constructive discussion. This suggests that the user's intent may be more focused on provoking a negative response than contributing to meaningful dialogue.
  
Conclusion:
The classification of hate speech is justified based on the clear presence of a severe ethnic slur, and the tweet's apparent aim to belittle or insult individuals of African and Jewish descent.

Key points supporting the classification:
1. While mentioning ""invasion of illegal immigrants,"" it's presented more as political commentary than hate speech.
2. The statement acknowledges Europe's role in sharing refugee burdens and discusses potential responses without using aggressive language.

1. The label ""normal"" implies that the content of the tweet is neither overtly hateful nor explicitly offensive. This classification suggests that while the language used might not be neutral, it doesn't cross the threshold into hate speech or direct offensiveness.

2. Although no specific key features are identified in this case, there could potentially be some implicit biases or assumptions present. The text mentions a group of celebrities who have been vocal about their dislike for Donald Trump and then speculates about potential connections to ""pedogate"" (a misspelling or shorthand for an alleged child abuse scandal). It also makes a connection between these individuals being queer and their outspokenness, which could suggest an underlying stereotype.

3. The tweet's target appears to be both the celebrities mentioned and the homosexual community. While there is some degree of speculation and potential insinuation regarding the celebrities' personal lives and motivations, it doesn't rise to direct hate speech or a clear attack on a protected group based solely on their identity.

4. Analyzing the context and tone can help gauge the user's intent. The tweet seems more focused on expressing frustration with these celebrities' political views and perceived hypocrisy than on directly attacking them for their sexual orientation or other personal characteristics.

5.

The text does not contain any overtly negative or targeted language that would categorize it as hate speech or offensive. While the user mentions being a ""self isolated homosexual,"" this appears to be a self-description rather than an attack on others.

Key points:
- No use of slurs, insults, or aggressive language.
- Self-referential tone without generalizing or targeting a group negatively.
- Acknowledgment of personal identity and feelings without promoting harm or animosity.

The user expresses a desire (""what I want to be"") contrasted with their current state (""what I am""), suggesting introspection rather than hostility. The lack of inflammatory language and absence of vilification toward any demographic reinforces the neutral classification.

- Use of profanity combined with a slur 
- Direct verbal attack on an individual based on race
- Blocking call shows intent to silence or dismiss based on identity

The target of this text is clear - it's aimed at African men and expresses disdain, aggression and rejection based solely on race. The tone is hostile, the language violent in nature.

In conclusion, this tweet employs a severe racial slur along with an aggressive action (blocking) which together constitute hate speech.

The word ""niggas"" is a variation of an extremely derogatory slur targeting African Americans.

Despite the absence of specific key features, the use of this term alone is enough to classify the text as hate speech. It directly targets a racial group in a negative context, which is the hallmark of hate speech.

The tweet's impact on its intended audience is likely to be highly inflammatory and insulting, causing significant offense to African Americans by perpetuating historical oppression and bigotry.

In terms of tone and intent, the repetition of ""weird"" suggests a disdainful or mocking attitude towards the targeted group. The user appears to be expressing contempt rather than engaging in genuine dialogue or humor.

In conclusion, based on the presence of an unambiguously racist slur and its degrading connotations towards African Americans, this text must be classified as hate speech.

1. The text is classified as normal, which suggests it does not contain hate speech or explicitly offensive content.

2. Key features are missing, but the tweet appears to express confusion about a statement regarding concert demographics. Without explicit derogatory terms or direct targeting of a group, it doesn't cross into hate speech or overtly offensive territory.

3. The target is not specified. While the text mentions ""white people,"" it's more an observation or question rather than a targeted attack or stereotype.

4. The context and tone imply confusion or surprise at a claim made elsewhere, rather than expressing malice or promoting harm.

5.

   - The repeated use of ""raghead"", a slur targeting Arab people, supports this classification. 
   - Mentioning specific locations known for Muslim populations (""Zamboanga"", ""Cotabato"") and labeling them as ""raghead territory"" contributes to the hate speech element.
3. Impact on Target: 
    - The language used targets Arab individuals and associates them with negative connotations, fostering a hostile environment against this group.
4. Context & Tone:
   - The speculative tone about someone's identity based solely on their presumed ethnicity or religious beliefs further cements its classification as hate speech.

1. The tweet contains a description of violence (""violently cut the dreadlocks off""), which could be disturbing for some readers.

2. It references sensitive political topics (Trudeau supporter, Syrian refugee), which in different contexts or with added details, might carry negative connotations.

3. The text includes a sense of perceived hypocrisy (""scheer hypocrisy""), suggesting a critical stance towards certain political figures or groups.

- No specific group is targeted in a hateful manner.

Explanation: The text expresses a generalization and stereotype that certain ethnic groups prioritize helping only their own kind, implying that there is an inherent lack of support or care from others. While the statement may be perceived as an opinion, it also contains undertones of divisiveness and discrimination. The inclusion of the phrase ""white supremacy"" further emphasizes a biased perspective towards race and wealth, which could potentially fuel resentment and hatred towards certain groups. This context, coupled with the overall tone and message, justifies its classification as offensive."

The text specifically references Freeman, seemingly attempting to link an individual with these targeted groups in a derogatory manner. This further amplifies the hate speech aspect by personalizing the attack.

The tone is hostile and demeaning, with no context provided that could justify such language as anything other than pure bigotry. The user's intent appears to be to incite hatred or violence against these groups through the use of degrading slurs.

The tweet's use of the term ""faggots"" is a clear indication of homophobic language. This slur demeans and targets individuals based on their sexual orientation.

Key features supporting this classification:
- The usage of ""faggots"", which is an aggressive, degrading term aimed at the homosexual community.
  
The context suggests the user is criticizing others' behavior by associating it with a derogatory term for homosexuals. This not only attacks the targeted group but also perpetuates negative stereotypes and hate.

The target of this hate speech is clearly the African American community, particularly those in positions of political power such as the mayor mentioned in the tweet. The user's intent seems to be questioning the legitimacy and suitability of a black person holding office, while also mocking their religious beliefs or cultural practices associated with voodoo.

- The language used reflects an underlying prejudice against the targeted group, with the term ""kike"" being a central part of this hostility. The user's tone also suggests resentment and opposition to Jewish people having any power or say in matters.

The key feature that supports this classification is the term ""spic"", an offensive slang often used to denigrate people of Hispanic origin. Additionally, the phrase ""smiling after such a tragedy"" suggests an insensitive response to a tragic event. The tweet also references shooters, which in context with the slur, could imply a negative stereotype about Hispanics being associated with violence.

The target group is clearly identified as Hispanic individuals who are referred to using the derogatory term. The tone of the tweet expresses anger and disdain, indicating a hostile intent towards this ethnic group.

This classification implies that the content does not contain hate speech or explicitly offensive language.

Key Features: 
- The phrase ""i hate you september"" expresses a strong dislike for the month of September but does not target any specific group or individual.
- The use of hyperbolic metaphor (""cried like thunder"") adds an element of drama to the user's expression of discontent, yet it remains within the bounds of typical emotional venting and is not directed at anyone.

Target:
- There is no explicit target in this tweet. The dislike is aimed towards a month (September), which is an abstract concept rather than a specific person or group.

Tone and Intent:
- The tone of the text is one of frustration and perhaps even melodrama, but it does not carry a malicious intent towards any identifiable target.
- The user's expression seems to be more about their personal feelings regarding the month of September, possibly due to negative experiences associated with it.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this tweet is categorized as normal because it lacks the hallmarks of hate speech or direct offensiveness.

Target Group and Intent:
- While there's no specific disability mentioned, the general term ""retard"" targets individuals with intellectual disabilities. The use of this slur reveals a malicious intent to demean and insult, making it a textbook example of hate speech.

Tone and Context:
- The tone is aggressive and demeaning. There's an absence of any context that could justify or soften the impact of these terms.

The tweet specifically insults men who are homosexual or fans of a rival sports team. The use of 'nigga' could also be seen as attempting to discredit the recipient by associating them with a racial slur in contrast to the sender's stated preference for a different NFL team (cowboys fan).

1. Usage of the word ""spic"" twice: This emphasizes the intent to target and offend Hispanics.
2. Mentioning it in relation to an individual's bio, implying that the user expected or wished for the targeted person to be Hispanic.

The tweet specifically targets a group based on their ethnicity and attempts to discredit or provoke them by using a derogatory term. Despite the claim of confusion (""i just got mixed up""), the repetitive use of the slur suggests a deliberate choice of language aimed at offending Hispanics.

Key points:
- The text mentions multiple publications (""daily mail"", ""spectator"", ""telegraph"") and groups (""right"", ""hippy labour lot""), suggesting a discussion of media bias and political ideologies.
- It references antisemitism, but the user does not make any explicitly antisemitic statements. Rather, they seem to be arguing against the notion that these entities are inherently antisemitic.
- The tone is somewhat argumentative but falls short of being directly aggressive or insulting toward any group.

In this context, while the topic could potentially veer into hate speech or offensiveness, the actual content appears to be a controversial opinion expressed without clear derision or hostility. Thus, despite touching on sensitive themes, it's classified as ""normal"" due to the lack of direct abusive language or promotion of hatred towards any group.

- Terms like ""pretrial incarceration"" and ""all lives matter"" are used to express an opinion without promoting violence or animosity against a protected class.
- Despite discussing serious issues, the tweet avoids inflammatory language that would categorize it as hate speech or offensive.

The user seems to be expressing frustration over not being able to interview individuals in pretrial detention. While critical of the situation and the sheriff's decision, the text stops short of employing aggressive or dehumanizing language that would justify a more severe classification.

The key feature ""dyke"" is a homophobic slur directed at homosexual women, which in this context is used to demean and insult the subject's wife. This term carries a strong negative connotation and is intended to belittle and degrade both the individual and the broader group she represents.

The tweet also includes aggressive language like ""lost"" and ""pissed off"", further intensifying its hostile tone and indicating extreme dissatisfaction or anger towards the targeted individuals - in this case, not only the woman but also the political figure mentioned. The reference to a prominent political leader with an altered name (""barack hussein obama"") adds another layer of negative sentiment and potential hate speech.

The context implies strong disapproval and contempt for the leftist political affiliation associated with the target. This aligns with typical characteristics of hate speech, which often involves attacking individuals or groups based on their inherent traits (such as sexual orientation) or beliefs (like political ideology).

In conclusion, the text is classified as hate speech because it employs highly offensive language to insult and degrade specific targets based on their sexual orientation and political leanings.

Key features supporting this classification include:

1. Reference to nude pictures: Mentioning ""nude pictures of older women"" is a clear violation of privacy and respect, reducing individuals to mere objects of sexual gratification.

2. Sex toys promotion: The inclusion of ""sex toys online"" suggests the intent to commercially exploit sexual content without considering its potential offensiveness or impact on vulnerable audiences.

3. Objectification of celebrities: Listing ""top <number> celebrity boobs"" dehumanizes public figures, treating them as mere body parts for voyeuristic pleasure.

The tone is commercial yet intrusive, targeting an audience interested in explicit sexual material and casual objectification. It fosters a culture of disrespect towards women by presenting them as sexual objects rather than individuals with dignity and rights.

Key features include the usage of ""lil black girl"" and ""white kids,"" which highlight the racial undertones of the statement. The target appears to be both African American and Caucasian children, as the tweet implies a conflict between them.

The context suggests that the author is referencing an incident where a black girl accused white children of cutting her hair. By questioning the validity of this claim and attributing it to ""hella games,"" the user is dismissing the seriousness of such acts and perpetuating negative stereotypes about black people being deceitful or prone to lying.

Moreover, the phrase ""already annoying as fuck"" clearly conveys a strong sentiment of frustration or disdain towards the subject matter, which in this case seems to be directed at the entire black community due to its generalization. 

Despite these inflammatory elements, the lack of explicit calls for violence or direct threats places it in a gray area between normal and hate speech. However, considering the historical context of such language and the potential harm it can cause by reinforcing negative societal biases, this text leans more towards being classified as hate speech.

1. The tweet's focus on personal responsibility and allyship in combating rape culture.
2. Absence of language that explicitly denigrates or attacks any group.
3. Tone of the message is serious but constructive, aiming to initiate change rather than promote hostility.

The tweet targets men who have influence over their peers, urging them to actively confront and challenge predatory behavior. By encouraging these individuals to ""keep calling out your predator friends,"" it advocates for a proactive approach to dismantling toxic norms.

While the topic of rape culture is sensitive and the tweet could be seen as confrontational, its intent appears to be raising awareness and advocating for change rather than promoting hate or offense against any group.

It appears to be a heated debate on a political topic without direct targeting of protected groups in a manner that would incite violence or prejudice.

1. Use of the term ""redneck"" - This word often refers to working-class white people from rural areas in a pejorative manner, suggesting backwardness or ignorance.
2. Reference to an isolated community - Mentioning ""in my neck of the redneck world"" implies a closed-off or sheltered environment, reinforcing stereotypes.

Furthermore, it equates the religion and its holy book to another faith, Mormonism, in a clearly pejorative manner. This comparison is made with an intent to belittle both religions and assert that they offer no value to human progress or civilization.

The overall tone is hostile and demeaning, displaying a clear disdain for Islam and its adherents. The use of such provocative language reveals a strong animosity towards the faith and aims to incite similar sentiments in others.

The statement ""should be deported to Africa where they belong"" advocates for forced displacement based on race, illustrating a clear intent to demean and persecute.

The text's aggressive tone and explicit calls for action against the identified target groups underscore its classification as hate speech. The user's intention appears to incite animosity and promote segregationist ideologies, which is evident through the language used and the proposals made.

The user's statement implies that Muslims had no role in the violence against Kashmiri Pandits but attributes this crime to Jews and Christians. This statement is offensive and misleading as historical records indicate that most perpetrators were indeed Kashmiri Muslims."

However, some key points should be considered:

1. **Classification Justification**: The post discusses a tragic incident involving a hit-and-run accident perpetrated by an individual referred to as ""a mussie,"" which is likely a misspelling or slang for ""Muslim."" Although the term could potentially be seen as pejorative when used in this context, it does not rise to the level of hate speech. The focus of the post is on the incident and its aftermath rather than on promoting animosity toward any group.

2. **Key Features**: There are no explicit key features that would categorize this text as hate speech or highly offensive. The mention of ""mussie"" in connection with a criminal act could be perceived negatively, but it's presented more as stating a fact about the perpetrator rather than inciting hatred.

3. **Impact on Target Group**: Although the post references a religious group (Muslims) in relation to a crime, it does not generalize this to all members of that community or encourage violence or discrimination against them. The story is specific and personal rather than a broad generalization or attack.

4. **Context and Tone**: The context is one of shared personal tragedy and the tone is more informative than inflammatory. It relays an account of an event without overtly aggressive language towards any group.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that the post does not contain clear incitement to hatred or violence, use blatantly dehumanizing language, or display a direct intent to offend a protected group, it's appropriate to classify it as normal. The content is more of a personal anecdote relayed by a third party than a deliberate attempt at spreading hate or offending others.

The text's focus on the individual incident and its consequences for the victim rather than broader negative generalizations about a religious or ethnic group supports this classification.",38.53,"[-2.2342553   4.105152   -2.3262668  ...  3.979709   -0.21063532

The tweet text contains a highly controversial and derogatory term for African Americans. This usage is inflammatory and intended to demean based on race. 

- The key feature here is the explicit use of the word ""nigga"", which is a version of a deeply offensive racial slur.
  
- Given this language, it's evident that the tweet targets black individuals in a denigrating manner. 

- While there are some additional words like ""free"" and ""hood hero"" that may attempt to change the context, they cannot neutralize or justify the use of such a potent slur.

- The tone is casual about its racism which makes it all the more dangerous as it attempts to normalize hate speech.

In conclusion, despite any secondary meanings or phrases, this tweet's central feature is an unambiguous racial slur used in a way that reinforces negative stereotypes and promotes harm against a targeted community.

This classification is supported by:
1. The combination of negative physical descriptions with sexual orientation slurs.
2. The use of aggressive language (""fuck em"") indicating violent intent or extreme disdain.
3. The broad targeting of multiple marginalized communities (women, homosexual individuals).

The overall tone is one of aggression and intolerance, creating a hostile environment for the targeted groups.

Explanation: The text implies an accusation towards certain individuals, using strong language and a serious allegation. While it does not directly contain hate speech towards a specific group, the overall tone and intensity of the statement can be considered offensive. It is important to remember that the absence of hate speech in a text does not necessarily make it acceptable or harmless. The use of accusatory language and strong emotions may still create a hostile environment for some readers, especially if the topic is sensitive or emotionally charged. In this case, it is best to classify the statement as offensive rather than normal or hate speech."

- The text narrates a personal, relatable experience without disparaging remarks.
- The inclusion of Mandarin phrases ""want ching chong"" conveys cultural context innocuously.

The tweet also expresses pleasure at the overthrow of Robert Mugabe, who is referred to using this slur, indicating a deep-seated animosity towards him based on his race.

The inclusion of ""anti-white"" further amplifies the hate speech element by suggesting that Mugabe's removal is somehow a victory against supposed anti-white sentiment. The use of ""comrade"" in this context also serves to mock and deride Mugabe and those who may have supported him. 

Given the extreme offensiveness of the language used, the clear targeting of an individual based on race, and the expression of joy at his misfortune, this text clearly falls into the category of hate speech.

Explanation:

While it contains colloquial and potentially loaded terms like ""dykes"" and ""gf,"" which could be seen as insensitive or exclusionary, the overall tone and context do not seem to promote animosity or harm towards the target groups (homosexuals and women).

Key features supporting this classification:
- The use of informal language (""love"", ""can not shut up"") indicates a casual tone rather than an aggressive one.
- The author expresses appreciation for others' life choices, even if they differ from societal expectations associated with feminism. 

Although some may find the terminology off-putting, the intent appears to be lighthearted commentary on subverting stereotypes. As such, while acknowledging potential sensitivity, it does not cross the threshold into hate speech or overt offensiveness.

In conclusion, despite surface-level language choices that could raise eyebrows, the overall message of acceptance and variety in life aspirations places this text firmly in the normal category upon deeper analysis.",25.2,"[ 1.4071549   3.3679225   0.84952796 ... 12.378644   -3.2284467

However, based on the available tweet text alone, it seems to reference religious identity (Muslim) and nationality (Pak - presumably referring to Pakistan).

Given the limited information, the classification of ""normal"" is tentatively appropriate here. The text makes a factual statement about religious and national identity without clear derision or aggression.

To comprehensively assess potential for hate speech or offensiveness though, more contextual data would be needed:
- What preceded this tweet to provide context?
- Were there inflammatory keywords redacted in the key features? 
- Is the target group referenced elsewhere with hostility?

Absent overt bigotry or targeted animus in this snippet alone, ""normal"" seems a reasonable default classification. But the missing elements raise questions about potentially exculpatory context that could alter this analysis.

However, there are a few elements that warrant further examination:

1. The label's implication: The classification of 'normal' suggests that the text does not contain overtly hateful or offensive content. 

2. Key features supporting this classification: The tweet seems to lack specific key features that would categorize it as hate speech or offensive, such as direct slurs or explicit targeting.

3. Impact on or reference to the target group: The mention of ""racist white hillbilly"" could be seen as potentially pejorative towards a certain demographic (rural Caucasians). However, without more context, it's unclear if this is being used mockingly by the author about themselves or others.

4. Context and tone assessment: There isn't enough information to fully gauge the user's intent. The text seems somewhat disjointed which makes determining its true meaning difficult.

Conclusion: Based on the available data, the classification of 'normal' appears to be justified primarily due to lack of clear indicators of hate speech or offensiveness. However, the mention of ""racist white hillbilly"" introduces some ambiguity that warrants caution in this assessment.

While discussing queer issues may be sensitive for some, the tone here is informative and does not contain any direct slurs or negative connotations that would justify labeling it as hate speech or even offensive. There are no key features identified that challenge this neutral classification.

Given the tweet's focus on highlighting a documentary rather than making any inflammatory statements about queer individuals or cheerleading in Croatia, its intent appears to be merely sharing information about an interesting film topic without promoting animosity or harm toward any group.

2. **Targeting**: It directly accuses the target audience (people who bring gay issues into unrelated discussions) of homophobia and insincerity in their allyship. The language used is inflammatory, further solidifying its offensiveness.

3. **Tone**: The tone of the message is combative and angry. This is evident through the use of capitalization for emphasis (""YOU""), profanity (""fuck off""), and direct accusations without room for discussion or understanding.

1. Label Implication: The classification ""normal"" suggests that while the text may contain critical or controversial content, it does not cross the threshold into hate speech or overt offensiveness.

2. Key Features Analysis:
- The key phrase ""both sides are bad poem"" implies a critique of a balanced approach to addressing social issues.
- Mentioning ""the rise in white supremacist violence and hate crimes"" provides context for the criticism but is not used in a way that promotes violence or hate itself.
- Focusing on ""outrage and accusations of false racism"" as the problem highlights perceived hypocrisy without directly attacking any group.

3. Target Group Impact: 
- The text criticizes what appears to be a poem or argument that it perceives as downplaying real issues by falsely equivocating two sides.
- While critical, this does not target any specific group in an aggressive or abusive manner.

4. Context and Tone Assessment:
- The tone is one of exasperation and critique, but falls short of hostility or aggression. 
- It engages in rhetorical criticism rather than ad hominem attacks.
- The user's intent seems to be calling out perceived flaws in reasoning or balance rather than promoting animus against any group.

5. Conclusion Justifying Classification:
- While the text contains strong criticism and references sensitive social issues, it does not employ slurs, promote violence/hatred, or directly target any group in a malicious way.
- The critique is framed more around perceived hypocrisy and flawed arguments rather than attacking individuals or groups.
- Therefore, despite its critical tone and subject matter, this tweet can be reasonably categorized as ""normal"" based on the provided classification criteria.",34.69,"[ 0.73460346 -0.25143892 -0.41927704 ...  5.3394413  -3.1167407

Explanation:
- text: ""it gonna be <date> in a row faggot golovkin fans will be crying robbery after this saturday night""
- The statement contains the term ""faggot,"" which is considered derogatory and hateful towards the LGBTQ+ community. Although it's not directly targeting Golovkin or his fans, the use of the slur implies a level of disrespect and hostility. Therefore, the classification is offensive.
- However, it's important to note that using the term ""faggot"" as a standalone insult may not always indicate an intent to promote hate speech. In some contexts, it might be used as a form of banter or casual insult among friends within the LGBTQ+ community itself. However, in this particular statement, the use of the slur seems intended to belittle and demean Golovkin fans, making it offensive in this context."

Here's a detailed explanation:

1. The label 'normal' suggests the text is neutral and devoid of inflammatory content. However, this classification seems inaccurate given the text's context.

2. Key features such as ""poor buggers"" and references to child abuse indicate a negative tone and potential offense. While no specific group is targeted, the language used is provocative and insensitive to victims of sexual violence.

3. The target is not clearly defined, but the text implies a generalized disdain for individuals who have committed heinous acts against children. This broad targeting lacks direct hate speech elements but fosters a hostile environment.

4. The tone is sarcastic and dismissive, trivializing serious crimes which suggests an intent to offend or provoke.

5. In conclusion, while not traditional hate speech, the text's cavalier treatment of child abuse and its demeaning language justify reclassifying it as offensive. The inflammatory nature and insensitive humor warrant a more critical classification than 'normal'.",26.14,"[ 0.8947376  -0.26145047  1.0794568  ...  8.808723   -0.29586247

1. The label 'Offensive' implies that the text contains language or ideas that could be perceived as insulting, disrespectful, or promoting prejudiced attitudes towards certain groups.

2. Key features supporting this classification include:
   - The phrase ""welcome to modern britain [sic]"" followed by a list of attributes (""white heterosexual male female non muslim"") suggests a sarcastic tone criticizing the state of free speech in Britain.
   - Accusations that being a ""white heterosexual male"" or having other listed characteristics is considered ""racist fascist homophobic islamophobic"" indicate an aggrieved stance against perceived societal norms or political correctness.

3. The text appears to target those who promote inclusiveness and equality, particularly regarding race, sexual orientation, and religion. It implies that modern British society unjustly labels people with the mentioned attributes as prejudiced, suggesting a sentiment of reverse discrimination.

4. The context and tone suggest a user expressing frustration or disagreement with what they perceive as excessive political correctness in Britain. They seem to be arguing against a societal shift towards greater inclusiveness and equality by characterizing it as restrictive to free speech for certain demographics.

5. In conclusion, the text is classified as 'Offensive' due to its sarcastic criticism of modern British society and its suggestion that promoting equality and challenging prejudice is itself prejudiced. The key features underscore a resistance to progressive social change and inclusiveness, aligning with a more conservative or reactionary viewpoint.",36.0,[-0.5386282  2.3380167 -1.2617841 ...  8.061376  -2.7541494  4.404238 ],1," offensive. The text targets specific groups and criticizes societal norms in a derogatory manner. While it may not meet the strict definition of hate speech, it contains language that is intended to offend and provoke strong reactions.

This classification is based on the following analysis:

1. The tweet does not contain any elements of hate speech or direct offensiveness towards a specific group or individual.
2. While the phrase ""hurt like a bitch"" uses strong language, it's commonly understood as expressing a high degree of emotional pain rather than targeting a specific group in a negative manner.
3. The context is about the emotional pain caused by the end of friendships, which is a relatable and universal human experience.

The tweet expresses personal feelings about a painful life event without promoting hate or directly offending any group, justifying its classification as normal.",14.2,"[ 2.6181843e+00  8.2314238e-03 -1.6698385e+00 ...  1.2258916e+01

1. **Label Implication**: The classification of ""Offensive"" suggests that the language used in the text is derogatory or inflammatory, potentially causing offense or distress to certain groups or individuals.

2. **Key Features Justifying Classification**:
    - The use of the term ""white bitch"" is a key feature that strongly supports this classification. This phrase combines a racial epithet with a gendered slur, making it particularly abusive and demeaning towards white women.

3. **Impact on Target Group**: Although no specific target group is identified in the provided data, the language used clearly targets individuals based on their race and gender. The term ""white bitch"" is intended to degrade and insult white women, potentially promoting a hostile environment for this demographic.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**: The tone of the text appears to be one of contempt or disdain towards Amber Guyger, an individual involved in a highly publicized case. However, without more context about who Amber Guyger is and what she did, it's challenging to fully gauge the user's intent. Regardless, the language used is unnecessarily inflammatory and serves no constructive purpose.

5. **Conclusion**: This text is classified as ""Offensive"" primarily due to its use of a highly provocative and demeaning phrase targeting an individual based on their race and gender. Despite any potential justification for criticism or disapproval of Amber Guyger's actions, the choice of language here crosses a line into outright bigotry and hatefulness.",30.59,[ 2.0685835  4.4912715 -1.2346996 ...  7.30035   -6.8949294  5.0071282],1, offensive

1. The text clearly falls under hate speech due to its inflammatory language and targeting of a religious group, specifically Islam.

2. Key features such as 'fires', 'crucifying', and the particularly derogatory term 'muzzie' (a slur against Muslims) directly contribute to this classification. These words invoke imagery of violence and hostility towards Muslims, indicating strong prejudice.

3. The target of this hate speech is Islam and its followers. The use of the term 'muzzie' demonstrates a clear intent to demean and incite violence against this group based on their religious beliefs.

4. Considering the context and tone, it's evident that the user intends to promote animosity and advocate for violent actions against Muslims. This exacerbates the severity of the hate speech, as it goes beyond mere insult and enters the realm of inciting physical harm.

5. In conclusion, the text is classified as hate speech due to its use of aggressive language, direct targeting of a religious group with a derogatory term, and its implicit call to violence against Muslims. The key features provide undeniable evidence of this intent, making it a clear case of hate speech.",28.1,[-1.696729   2.511346  -2.247486  ...  7.489467  -5.641309   4.6008825],0, hate speech

The user's argument focuses on the inappropriateness of calling victims of sexual assault 'prostitutes' and the implication that monetary settlements can perpetuate a culture that trivializes rape.

Key points supporting this classification include:
- The text does not contain slurs, explicit language, or direct attacks against any group.
- It presents an opinion in a public discourse manner without inciting hate or offense.
- The subject matter is sensitive but addressed in a factual and reasoned tone.

The tweet's intent appears to be contributing to a debate on the role of monetary settlements in sexual assault cases. Though discussing a serious issue, it does not employ aggressive or provocative language that would qualify as hate speech or intentionally offensive.

Summary:
- The user self-identifies as a ""hillbilly"" and expresses disdain for Breitbart news but admits to understanding its appeal. 

Key Features:
- The term ""hillbilly"" could be seen as self-deprecating humor rather than hate speech or offense towards others.
- Expressing dislike for Breitbart doesn't target any group offensively.

Target Group Impact:
- No specific group is targeted negatively in the text.

Context and Tone Assessment: 
- The tone is more of personal opinion and admission of understanding, lacking aggressive intent.

Conclusion:
The classification as normal is justified. Though ""hillbilly"" might be considered a stereotype, its self-applied usage here lacks malicious intent.

- Lack of clearly defined target group 
- Ambiguous intent behind the language used

While the language is crude and potentially inflammatory, classifying it as ""normal"" may be justifiable if this was intended as general frustration rather than an attack on a specific person or group. The missing context makes a conclusive assessment challenging.

In summary, while problematic terms are present, their application here isn't evidently motivated by prejudice towards a protected group based solely on the given text. An argument could be made for an ""offensive"" label due to the insult and profanity, but I lean towards ""neutral"" pending additional context about the intent and target.

The use of explicit language and the sexual reference adds to the offensiveness of the statement.

Key features such as ""chink"" and ""pussy"" contribute to this classification by combining a derogatory term with a sexually charged word, perpetuating ethnic stereotypes in a demeaning manner.

The tweet specifically targets individuals of Asian descent, particularly those of Chinese origin, by using a slur that has historically been used to demean and insult. The reference to not wanting to ""break that record"" suggests a pre-existing prejudice or aversion towards the targeted group, further solidifying its offensiveness.

Although the tone may be interpreted as humorously intended, the use of explicit and denigrating language undermines this interpretation and reinforces the offensiveness of the tweet.

2. While no specific target group is mentioned, the usage of such language carries broad negative connotations and can promote marginalization or mistreatment of already disadvantaged groups.

3. The context and tone suggest frustration or disdain from the speaker, revealing a prejudiced mindset rather than any legitimate critique or discussion. This further contributes to its offensiveness.

The term ""yid"" is a pejorative slur targeting individuals of the Jewish faith, and referring to them as ""tapeworms"" further dehumanizes and vilifies this group by equating them with parasites. 

The key features that led to this classification are:

1. Usage of the slur ""yid"": This term is inherently anti-Semitic and contributes significantly to the hate speech label.
2. Dehumanizing language: By referring to Jewish people as ""tapeworms"", the tweet employs extreme rhetoric, comparing a human group to a parasite, which is indicative of hate speech.

Key phrases such as ""bigoted conservative muzzies"" and ""no concept of human rights"" demonstrate a strong bias against Muslims, portraying them as inherently intolerant and opposed to fundamental human rights.

The inclusion of slurs like ""muzzies"" alongside aggressive language creates an environment of hostility and prejudice. This is exacerbated by the reference to ""baeh muslim dhivehinge khaalath varah dhera ingeythoww"", furthering the sense of disdain towards the targeted group.

This text clearly intends to incite hatred against Muslims, painting them in a negative light and promoting an us-versus-them mentality. The use of dehumanizing language serves to distance and alienate the target group, fostering division and animosity.

Given that the tweet is neutrally stating a fact without apparent malice or promotion of the term's usage, it falls into the ""normal"" category. However, the phrase ""illegal aliens"" could be seen as insensitive and potentially contributes to negative stereotypes about undocumented immigrants.

The tweet is classified as offensive due to the usage of the term ""beaner,"" which is a derogatory slur aimed at individuals of Mexican descent. This term contributes significantly to the offense, as it perpetuates negative ethnic stereotypes and marginalizes the targeted group.

The key feature supporting this classification is the word ""beaners."" The tweet expresses surprise at the number of Hispanic individuals in the town and questions their presence, which further reinforces the offensive nature of the statement. The tone implies a sense of superiority over the targeted group, thus making it more problematic.

The context of the tweet suggests that the user posted on Craigslist's ""Rants & Raves"" section to express dissatisfaction with the demographic composition of the town, specifically targeting Hispanic individuals. This indicates an intent to denigrate and provoke negative sentiments towards this ethnic group.

In conclusion, the tweet is classified as offensive due to its explicit use of a derogatory term that targets Hispanic individuals, fostering ethnic stereotypes and creating a hostile environment for the target group.",22.88,[-1.0001698 -2.7271526 -2.644176  ...  6.413268  -2.0881724  5.2382154],2, offensive

It mentions that if refugees break the law, they are subject to immediate removal according to these laws. The tweet is classified as normal because it does not contain any overtly hate speech or offensive language.

Key Features:
- Reference to immigration laws and deportation: This shows a focus on legal aspects without using inflammatory language.
- Mention of consequences for breaking the law: It states facts about legal ramifications, avoiding pejorative terms or personal attacks. 

Target Group:
The tweet refers to refugees in a general sense, but it does not specifically target them with hate or offend them.

Context and Tone:
- The tone is informative rather than aggressive.
- It presents an opinion based on the interpretation of immigration laws without inciting hatred or displaying prejudice.

Conclusion:
Given these points, the classification of normal is justified. Despite discussing a potentially sensitive issue, it does so objectively and without employing language that could be classified as hate speech or overtly offensive.",20.0,[ 3.806019   2.129586  -3.715366  ...  1.4556637  5.044598  -1.4492635],1, normal

The key feature that supports this classification is the explicit reference to ""muzzie love,"" which perpetuates negative stereotypes and suggests hostility towards the target group.

The tweet's intent appears to incite violence by sarcastically suggesting that those who ""embrace"" Arab or Islamic individuals should undergo female genital mutilation (FGM) themselves. This not only trivializes the serious issue of FGM but also promotes harm against both the target group and their supporters.

In conclusion, the text is classified as hate speech due to its use of a derogatory slur, the promotion of violence, and the targeting of individuals based on their ethnic and religious background.

1. The label ""normal"" suggests that while the language used is coarse, it doesn't rise to the level of hate speech or targeted offensiveness. 

2. Key features are not explicitly highlighted, but the phrase ""you hate me fuck you too"" includes strong language. However, this appears more like a juvenile retort rather than systematic hate.

3. Without explicit context, it's hard to determine a specific target. The generalization of ""you"" makes the scope broad and unspecific.

4. The tone is aggressive and hostile due to the curse words used. It suggests an immature response to perceived animosity.

5. In conclusion, despite the aggressive language, this text falls under normal rather than hate speech or targeted offensiveness. There's no clear context of systematic targeting or promotion of violence against a specific group. The coarse language, while potentially upsetting, is not used in service of broader bigotry or prejudice, aligning it more with an emotionally charged but ultimately non-malicious outburst.

- The phrase ""game of dead niggas"" is a clear indicator of hate speech, as it references death in association with a deeply offensive slur.
- The term ""dumb ass niggas"" further reinforces this classification by combining ableist and racist slurs.
- Despite the absence of specified targets, the text's general direction towards a minority group through pejorative terms is evident.

- Mention of 'efcc' losing their integrity
- Call to action to tag/retweet

These elements suggest disagreement and a call for collective action but don't contain direct attacks or inflammatory language that would categorize this as hate speech or even necessarily offensive. The target 'efcc' is referenced critically but not in a way that directly promotes animosity.

Given the context, it appears more like an expression of opposition or disappointment rather than incitement to hatred or violence, so classifying it as normal seems reasonable based on the available information.

In conclusion, while critical of 'efcc', this text lacks the explicit hostility, inflammatory language, or direct targeting that would warrant labeling it hate speech or even definitively offensive.

The tweet does not employ slurs, insults, or dehumanizing language targeting any group. While critical of government handling of gender-based violence, it stops short of encouraging hostility or prejudice towards men in general.

The tweet's usage of the term ""nigger"" directly targets African individuals in a dehumanizing manner. The comparison to a gingerbread man further reduces the humanity and dignity of the referenced group.

Key features:
- The use of ""nigger"", an extremely derogatory and inflammatory slur, is central to the classification as hate speech.
  
The impact on the target group:
- African people are directly targeted by this tweet, which compares them to non-human objects in a demeaning way. 

Context and tone:

The tweet's reference to Princess Diana's illegitimate son adds an element of sensationalism but does not directly contribute to its offensiveness. However, coupling this with the slur intensifies the offense by associating a derogatory term with a topic of public interest or celebrity gossip.

In conclusion, the presence of 'negress' as key feature is sufficient to classify this tweet as offensive due to its direct targeting and demeaning connotations towards Africans.

The target of this offense is clearly women, as the statement directly refers to them in a degrading manner. By using such language, the user perpetuates negative stereotypes and contributes to a culture that disrespects women.

Considering the tone and context, it seems likely that the intent was to objectify and demean women for humorous or attention-seeking purposes. This makes the impact even more concerning as it normalizes the use of degrading language towards women in casual conversation.

In conclusion, this text is classified as offensive due to its blatant use of a derogatory term targeting women and promoting an attitude that demeans them. The analysis of the key feature, target group, tone, and intent all support this classification.",25.98,[ 0.6708908 -0.987923  -6.2437572 ...  7.93342   -5.610467   5.4949455],2," offensive.

Key Features Analysis:
- The use of the term ""bitches"" directly targets women in a derogatory manner, reinforcing negative stereotypes and potentially promoting misogyny.

Impact on Target Group:

Tone and Intent Assessment:
- The tone is casual yet demeaning, indicating a lack of respect towards women. The user's intent appears to be boastful but is conveyed in a manner that demeans the targeted group.

Conclusion:
- The classification as 'offensive' is justified by the use of explicitly degrading language aimed at women, creating an environment of disrespect and contributing to gender-based hostility. Despite any potential intent for humor or bravado, the choice of words makes the text unequivocally offensive towards the target group.",25.44,[ 3.0977983  3.036998  -1.0801407 ...  5.7605968 -3.1434395  2.1817982],2," offensive.

However, it does reference sensitive political ideologies and accusations of racism, which may be seen as potentially inflammatory.

The tweet lacks direct discriminatory language or personal attacks, focusing instead on criticisms regarding alleged associations with extreme political groups. While it suggests a negative insinuation about the target's beliefs or supporters, it doesn't cross into hate speech by using slurs or advocating violence/harm.

In summary, despite touching on controversial political topics and making serious accusations, this tweet falls short of the criteria for hate speech or direct offense due to its lack of overtly abusive language or incitement.

While it expresses a strong opinion about the incompatibility of arts appreciation with support for right-wing racists and white nationalists, it does not directly employ hate speech or specifically offensive language.

- The tweet argues that individuals who align with certain political ideologies cannot genuinely appreciate music, design, and art.
- Although the tone is critical and the message suggests a moral judgment on those supporting specific political views, it stops short of using overtly abusive terms or direct attacks.
- The term ""fraud"" could be perceived as mildly aggressive but lacks the severity to categorize this tweet as hate speech or blatantly offensive.

In conclusion, despite its strong stance and critical tone towards individuals with certain political affiliations, the tweet's content does not cross the line into hate speech or highly offensive territory.

Key features:
- The phrase ""be raped"" trivializes sexual violence and uses it in a flippant manner.
- It references a historical conflict between China and Japan, reducing complex geopolitical events to a crude, dehumanizing analogy.

The target appears to be the nation of China and its people during World War II. The user's question employs shock value by likening an entire country's experience in wartime to being ""raped"". This choice of words strips agency from China, presenting it solely as a victim without acknowledging its resilience or resistance efforts.

Analyzing the context and tone, the tweet seems designed to provoke rather than seek genuine information. The user adopts a confrontational stance by leading with an accusation disguised as a question. 

In conclusion, this text qualifies as hate speech due to its reliance on graphic sexual violence to diminish and insult a nation and its people based on historical events.

- The tweet uses a highly inflammatory racial slur (""nigger"") and an obscure, potentially derogatory term (""spaboolie""), targeting prominent African-American figure Oprah Winfrey. 
- It employs aggressive language, indicating intent to confront with bigotry.
- Fat-shaming adds another layer of offensiveness, compounding the insult.

The classification is justified by the tweet's direct usage of a notorious racial epithet and additional disparaging terms aimed at a specific individual from an African background.

The text does not appear to negatively target any group or promote hate. While it contains some slang terms, these are used affectionately rather than offensively.

While the context involves sensitive language, the tone lacks animosity or endorsement, focusing instead on the child's apathy.

Key Features:
- Mention of an ethnic slur but without direct usage or promotion.

Target Group Impact: 
- The target groups are indirectly referenced (African, None), but there is no direct offense or hate directed towards them in this recounting.

Context and Tone Assessment:
- The context involves discussing a past event with a child.
- The user's intent seems to be sharing an anecdote about societal desensitization rather than promoting hate or causing offense.

The text contains a highly derogatory term targeting black individuals. The use of the word ""niggas"" is deeply offensive and perpetuates negative stereotypes about black men's behavior towards women.

Key features that support this classification:
- The use of an extremely inflammatory racial slur.
- The broad generalization and negative portrayal of an entire demographic group based on race and gender.

The text targets black men, painting them as uniformly ""weird"" in their approach to females. This further entrenches the dehumanizing effect of the chosen slur.

Considering the context and tone, the user's intent appears to be expressing disdain or superiority over the targeted group. The statement is broad and lacks any specific examples that could provide a reasonable explanation for this generalization.

3. **Exploitation of Stereotypes**: The tweet leverages stereotypes about Pakistani shopkeepers and their business practices, portraying them as dishonest or exploitative for financial gain.

4. **Devaluation of Target Group**: By reducing the shopkeeper to a stereotype and using an insulting nickname derived from his religion, the tweet devalues both the individual and the broader group he represents.

1. The label's implication: Hate speech involves language that expresses prejudice or encourages violence towards a specific group. In this case, the target is the Jewish community.

2. Key features supporting classification:
   - ""greedy"", ""hook nose"", and ""kike"" are all terms with strong negative connotations used to stereotype and demean Jewish individuals.
   - The hypothetical scenario of causing a country to suffer famine if given the opportunity further perpetuates the hateful stereotype of greed associated with this group.

3. Impact on or reference to the target:
    - The language used directly attacks and vilifies the Jewish community, attributing negative characteristics and intentions to them. This can incite animosity and hostility from others towards this group.

   - The tone is highly aggressive and accusatory, indicating a clear intent to offend and spread hate about the target group.

Explanation: The user's statement includes a reference to a past experience of being targeted with homophobic slurs, which can be considered offensive due to the derogatory nature of the language used. Although the statement itself does not directly incite hate speech or promote harm towards others, it does reflect an experience of intolerance and discrimination. Additionally, the comparison of Northern Ireland to being ""exceptionally garbage when it comes to progressiveness"" can be seen as making a negative generalization about the region and its people, which may contribute to a broader atmosphere of intolerance and hate speech. However, it's important to note that the user is sharing an anecdotal experience and not actively promoting or using hate speech in the present moment."

The user expresses an unwillingness to support the Muslim Brotherhood and equates it with socialism, which is used here pejoratively. This comparison serves to further vilify and create fear around the Muslim group.

The tone of the text is hostile and conspiratorial, reinforcing negative stereotypes about Muslims. The use of such language and sentiments towards a religious group categorizes this as hate speech.

This aggressive tone implies violent intent towards innocent bystanders if they are perceived as obstructing the path to eliminating the targeted individual referred to by the slurs. The user expresses no remorse for potential collateral damage but rather anticipates satisfaction in self-defense.

The combination of explicit hate speech and implicit endorsement of violence creates an environment that normalizes and promotes animosity towards these communities. Therefore, this text is not only classified as hate speech due to its language but also because it advocates harm against specific demographics.

1. **Label Implication**: Classifying a text with such provocative content as 'normal' could be erroneous. The tweet contains strong accusations against a specific group (Pakistanis) and their religious beliefs (Islam), suggesting a more fitting classification might be 'offensive' or even 'hate speech'.

2. **Key Features Analysis**: Though the key features field is empty, critical phrases like ""hindus are being murder"", ""<number> <number> years hindu girls being raped"" and ""mandatory for pakis to rape hindu women before converting them"" carry strong negative connotations. These phrases contribute to a hostile tone and potentially promote animosity towards Pakistanis and Muslims.

3. **Target Group Impact**: The text explicitly targets followers of Islam and residents of Pakistan, insinuating systematic violence and oppression against Hindus. This could incite hatred or prejudice among readers, amplifying inter-religious tensions.

4. **Context and Tone Evaluation**: The tweet's tone is aggressive and accusatory, using hyperbolic claims about violence and sexual assault. This suggests an intent to provoke emotional responses rather than foster open discussion, a hallmark of content classified as 'offensive' or 'hate speech'.

5. **Conclusion Justification**: Despite the given classification of 'normal', this text appears more aligned with characteristics of 'offensive' content due to its provocative language, targeted accusations and inflammatory tone. The mention of sensitive issues like murder and rape in a generalizing manner further supports an argument for reclassification as 'hate speech'. However, without additional context about the source or audience's typical discourse style, a definitive classification is challenging.

In summary, while initially labeled as 'normal', this text exhibits features more characteristic of 'offensive' or potentially 'hate speech'. A nuanced analysis reveals that it employs hostile language, targets specific groups, and discusses sensitive topics in a provocative manner - factors which significantly undermine its purported normalcy.",40.0,[ 1.7569696 -2.587047  -1.4995757 ...  8.704766  -2.3192008  0.6214103],1, hate speech

4. Considering tone and intent, it reads more like a harmless personal statement than an aggressive provocation. There's no apparent desire to offend or promote bigotry.

The tweet contains a strong racial slur (""niggers"") directed at the targeted group (African). This term is deeply offensive and its usage indicates clear animosity and hostility.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- The use of ""niggers"", an explicit and inflammatory racial slur, which reveals the author's intent to denigrate and insult.
  
The context suggests that the author is accusing the targeted group of slander and hate without justification, further intensifying the hostile tone.

The phrase implies that the mere presence or scent of black people is enough to repel insects, comparing them to vermin in a dehumanizing manner.

The target group for this hate speech is clearly African individuals, with the language used serving to degrade and insult based on race. The user's intent appears to be to provoke anger or disdain towards black people by implying they are sub-human and undesirable.

These phrases serve to denigrate and stereotype both groups, attributing negative behaviors and characteristics to them based solely on their ethnicity or religion.

The text's impact is particularly severe given its broad generalizations about entire communities. By equating Indians with perpetrators of sexual violence and portraying Muslims as inherently uncivilized, it promotes animosity and hostility towards these groups.

3. Target: There isn't a specific targeted audience except perhaps those who hold regressive views on race and gender. 

4. Context and tone: The tweet seems to be critiquing the misuse of science to justify prejudices against certain genders or ethnicities. It uses sarcasm and hyperbole (e.g., ""futuristic stupidity"") to ridicule such notions.

The key feature, ""nigger,"" is an extremely derogatory term historically used to demean African Americans. This choice of language reveals a clear intent to insult and degrade based on race.

The target group in this context is unequivocally African or African American individuals, with the tweet specifically directing its hostility towards a prominent Black figure. The use of such a provocative slur indicates an attempt to undermine Obama's status by reducing him to the basis of his race in a demeaning manner.

Considering the tone and the inflammatory nature of the language used, it is evident that the user's intent was not merely to express disagreement or critique but to inflict harm through overtly racist means. This contextual understanding reinforces the classification of this tweet as hate speech.

3. However, the tweet lacks explicit threats or calls to violence, which might have pushed it into the hate speech category.

The key features reinforcing this classification include:

1. Use of the term ""nigga"", which is an extreme racial slur.
2. The phrase ""rip ur kneecap off"", suggesting graphic violence.

Explanation: The text contains multiple forms of hate speech targeting different groups.

1. Homophobic slur: ""gay nigga"" - Using 'gay' as a pejorative term to demean someone based on their sexual orientation and combining it with the racial slur 'nigga' intensifies the harm.
2. Threat of violence: ""will rip ur kneecap off"" - The threat of physical violence is a form of intimidation and fear-mongering, which can be particularly distressing when directed towards marginalized groups.
3. Racial slur: ""them niggas"" - Using the racial slur 'nigga' reinforces racist stereotypes and perpetuates discrimination against Black people.
4. Generalization and dehumanization: ""they're too powerful"" - This statement implies that members of the targeted groups possess an inherent power or strength that is threatening, which can fuel fear and prejudice.

Given the presence of multiple forms of hate speech in the text, it is essential to recognize and address this harmful content to create a more inclusive and respectful environment."

The tweet uses explicit language like ""fuck off"" and references to child rape, which could be seen as highly offensive. However, upon closer examination, key points indicate it may not quite reach the threshold for hate speech or even a purely offensive classification:

- The aggressive language seems directed at an individual's perceived political correctness rather than targeting any specific group based on race, gender, religion etc.
- References to ""language of the streets"" and ""no pc bullshit"" suggest frustration with overly polite discourse obscuring serious issues. 
- It doesn't appear to promote violence or harm, but is expressing anger at what's seen as inaction due to focus on ""niceties"".
- No particular group is clearly denigrated based on identity.

So while the tweet uses very harsh and explicit language, its target seems more abstract ideas around political correctness rather than any demographic group. Its intent appears to passionately express a viewpoint that serious problems are being ignored.

Therefore, despite the coarse phrasing which pushes boundaries of polite discourse, I would classify this as ""normal"" speech in line with the provided label. The key factors seem to be:

1) Individual target 
2) Political topic and motivation
3) Lack of overt group-based animus

Rather than an unambiguous case of hate or offensiveness, it falls more into the category of a heated opinion expressed with extreme informality and vulgarity that's become normalized in certain online spaces. An argument could be made for ""offensive"" due to the graphic language, but its classification leans ""normal"" when factoring in context and apparent intent.",39.92,[ 3.0545561  4.3782034 -4.572098  ...  7.087045  -1.2724184  3.9044905],1," offensive.

- The tone is informative and opinionated without being aggressive or inflammatory.

Key features such as ""spear"" and ""chucking"" imply violent action, reinforcing the aggressive tone.

The tweet employs the term ""faggot,"" which is a homophobic slur used to target individuals identifying as homosexual. This creates an overtly hostile and demeaning environment for the targeted group.

This reflects a deeper prejudice against individuals who express themselves through unique clothing choices, often linked to homophobic attitudes.
- The tweet targets the homosexual community with the use of aggressive language alongside the slur. This combination serves not only to demean but also to enforce societal norms about appearance and behavior, fostering an environment where such prejudices are normalized.

The language is not only inflammatory but also incites violence by mentioning that ""our lads beat the crap out of pakis."" The tweet also delegitimizes journalistic integrity, claiming they are ""lying bastards"" for reporting on these incidents. 

The intent behind this text appears to be the promotion of hate and division based on race, religion, and national origin. By targeting specific groups with false accusations and aggressive language, it aims to foster animosity and hostility.

In conclusion, the classification of this tweet as hate speech is justified by its use of extreme pejorative terms, baseless accusations of criminal activity, calls to violence, and attacks on journalistic credibility - all aimed at demonizing Arab, Islamic, and refugee populations.",23.87,[ 4.274372   3.9664946 -7.276799  ... 11.274824   3.8890154 -4.9460964],0," offensive.

Key features supporting this classification include:
- The repeated use of the slur ""kike"" which is a highly derogatory term for Jews.
- The phrase ""oven them all"" which chillingly references genocidal mass murder of Jews in Nazi death camps. 
- Targeting Jews and refugees with eliminationist rhetoric goes far beyond mere offensiveness into the realm of dangerous hate speech inciting violence.

The tone is one of angry, exterminationist hatred, not merely expressing an opinion but calling for a group to be ""ovened"", i.e., brutally murdered en masse. This crosses the line from protected speech into unlawful incitement.

In summary, this post earns a hate speech classification through its use of vicious slurs and horrifying calls for genocidal violence against Jews. The key features leave no doubt as to the virulently anti-Semitic intent behind the language used.

The text falls into the normal category because it lacks any clear hate speech or overtly offensive language. The user appears to be sarcastically listing various political and social labels in a humorous manner, suggesting that such labels are ""dumb"". 

Key features supporting this classification:
- No direct attacks or use of slurs against any group.
- Sarcastic tone implying criticism of simplistic labeling.

While the text mentions sensitive topics like race (white) and political ideologies (Nazi, fascist), it does so in a sarcastic way that undermines those labels rather than promoting animosity. The tweet seems to be more of a commentary on the overuse and absurdity of applying reductive labels.

The context and playful tone indicate the user is not seriously endorsing any of the listed views but mocking the practice of facile categorization. The tweet does not contain direct hostility or malice towards any target, supporting its classification as normal speech rather than hate speech or even offensiveness.

Target group:
- The language is directly aimed at individuals within the African American community, making them the target of this hostility.

Context and tone:
- The aggressive wording and demand to ""get [...] out of here"" suggests an intent to threaten or intimidate. It conveys a strong sense of disdain and rejection towards the targeted individual and by extension, his entire community.

This pejorative phrase has been historically associated with xenophobia and racism towards Asian individuals.

Key Features:
- The use of ""ching chong"" directly targets and mocks Chinese people, reinforcing negative stereotypes.
- The question regarding access to Twitter further implies an exclusivity that is racially motivated.

Impact on Target Group:
- The tweet specifically singles out a person of presumed Chinese origin using a slur, intending to demean and otherize them based on their ethnicity.
- It perpetuates xenophobic attitudes and can contribute to a hostile environment for the targeted group.

Context and Tone Analysis:
- The tone appears to question another user's identity in a mocking way, dismissing their presence on the platform due to geographical restrictions. This further implies that individuals from certain regions or ethnic backgrounds should be excluded.
  
Conclusion:
Based on these points, the classification of hate speech is justified as it contains explicit language intended to demean and stereotype an individual based on their ethnicity.

The key features supporting this classification include the use of terms like ""muzzie,"" which is a derogatory term for Muslims, and phrases such as ""evil vile savage and despicable soulless character,"" which are used to describe Islam and its followers. This creates an environment of hate and bigotry by attributing negative actions (e.g., ""rapes in sweden"") to an entire religious group.

The target of the text is clear: Islam and, by extension, Muslims. The language is designed to provoke animosity towards this group by portraying them as inherently violent and evil. 

In analyzing the tone and context, it's evident that the user intends to spread fear and hostility towards Muslims, particularly in the context of immigration and cultural integration (e.g., ""savage 3 rd world cretins""). The choice of words like ""unfettered assault"" and ""can no longer hide it evil vile savage"" suggests a deep-seated animosity.

In conclusion, this text is classified as hate speech because it employs inflammatory language to vilify an entire religious group based on stereotypes and misinformation. It aims to incite hatred by attributing criminal acts to the target's inherent characteristics, using terms that dehumanize and demonize them.",31.08,[ 2.7087073  3.4108882 -4.4949045 ...  9.070261   3.6682434 10.573444 ],0, hate speech

The tweet uses the term ""raghead,"" which is a derogatory slur directed at individuals of Arab or Middle Eastern descent. This language choice reveals a clear intent to demean and stereotype based on ethnicity.

Key Features:
- The usage of ""raghead"" is central in classifying this text as offensive due to its explicit and direct targeting of an ethnic group using negative stereotypes.
  
Target Group Impact:
- The term specifically targets Arab or Middle Eastern individuals, promoting prejudice against these groups by linking them pejoratively with the author's discontent.

Tone and Intent:
- The tone is hostile and disparaging. By accusing someone of profiting from associations with ""raghead pals,"" it implies that the individual is disreputable and that their success is due to unsavory connections rather than merit.
  
Conclusion:
- This tweet is classified as 'offensive' because it employs a blatant ethnic slur to insult and stigmatize based on ethnicity, revealing an intent to offend. The term ""raghead"" carries historical baggage of bigotry and its use here reinforces negative stereotypes, creating a hostile environment for the target group.",22.81,"[ 1.0711175  -1.1518916   0.8734875  ... 10.12687    -0.26067117

Here's a brief analysis:

1. The label 'normal' implies that the content of the tweet does not contain any elements of hate speech or offensiveness.

2. Although there are no specifically identified key features, the tweet seems to be educating or reminding readers about the full acronym of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender). It emphasizes that each letter in the acronym represents a distinct identity within the community.

3. There is no direct target mentioned in this context; however, it could be seen as supporting the visibility of identities often overlooked or misunderstood within the larger scope of the LGBT community.

4. The tone of the tweet seems informative and assertive rather than aggressive or malicious. 

5. In conclusion, the classification of 'normal' is justified based on the lack of any inflammatory language, intent to offend, or direct targeting of a group in a negative manner. Instead, it appears to be advocating for awareness and inclusion.",20.13,[ 1.2495904  3.1581497  3.240947  ...  8.223958  -7.891323   1.9206262],1, normal

It employs the terms ""picaninny"" and ""spaff,"" which seem to be informal or slang terms, possibly intended to imply a lack of substance and style over content, respectively.

- **Label Implication**: The classification as normal suggests that while the text contains criticism, it does not rise to the level of hate speech or overt offensiveness. 
- **Key Features Analysis**: The key features mentioned are ""picaninny"" (possibly implying triviality or lack of substance) and ""spaff"" (likely suggesting a focus on appearance). These terms critique the target's approach but do not contain explicitly hateful or derogatory language.
- **Target Impact**: Without clear context, it's hard to gauge the specific impact. However, the criticism appears to be directed at an individual's character rather than targeting a group based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, ethnicity, religion).
- **Context and Tone Evaluation**: The tone is critical but not virulently hostile or aggressive. It seems to critique what the author perceives as superficiality in the target's approach.
- **Conclusion Justifying Classification**: The text criticizes an individual for prioritizing appearance over substance, using informal language that may be seen as mildly negative but does not cross into hate speech or direct offensiveness. Therefore, its classification as normal is justified based on the analysis of its content and tone, which lacks explicit harm or offense to a specific group or individual beyond general criticism.",34.34,[ 0.1604726  1.1470304 -2.758368  ...  5.71115   -0.8412907  2.7511165],1," offensive.

The tweet also references legal penalties for using another controversial term, ""illegal alien"", but then dismisses concerns over the usage of the racial epithet.

The target of this text appears to be African-Americans, as evidenced by the use of the slurs ""nigger"" and ""niggers"". The user seems to be expressing frustration or anger at perceived inconsistencies in what is considered socially or legally acceptable language. 

The context of the tweet suggests a tone of indignation and defiance, with the user challenging societal norms around language use. The phrase ""tuesday thoughts"" also implies that this might be a regular feature where the user shares controversial opinions.

While it could potentially be seen as promoting a conspiracy theory or misinformation, it lacks overtly aggressive language or direct attacks on any specific group. 

Key features:
- The mention of ""african and moslem artifacts"" being planted suggests an attempt to manipulate historical narratives but does not directly incite hatred.
- The phrase ""real swedes are not indigenous to sweden"" could be interpreted as questioning Swedish identity, though it doesn't use overtly hostile or aggressive language.

Impact on target group:
- Swedes may potentially feel misrepresented by the claim that they are not indigenous to Sweden. However, this is presented more as a speculative assertion than an attack.
- Africans and Muslims are referenced in regards to artifact planting but are not directly targeted with hostility.

Context and tone assessment: 
- The tweet seems to be discussing theories around historical manipulation rather than promoting hate against specific groups.
- While the underlying sentiment could come from a place of xenophobia or nationalism, the language used doesn't clearly cross into hate speech territory.

1. The label 'normal' suggests that the tweet does not contain overtly hateful or extremely offensive content.
2. However, the key features field is empty, which makes it difficult to identify specific elements supporting the normal classification conclusively. 
3. The phrase ""intentionally scare hoes"" could be seen as problematic for several reasons:
   - The term ""hoes"" is a slang term that is often used pejoratively to refer to women.
   - Encouraging intentional fear or harm towards any group, especially one based on gender, is concerning and could be considered hate speech or harassment depending on the full context.
4. Without more context about the intended meaning or target of this tweet, it's challenging to fully assess the user's intent. The language used raises potential red flags.
5. In conclusion, while classified as normal by the model, I would argue this text contains wording that could be seen as promoting targeted harassment and misogyny, which may warrant a more nuanced classification like 'offensive' or even 'hate speech' if additional context supported those interpretations.

While it does not explicitly contain hate speech or directly offensive language, there are nuances that could be perceived as problematic.

1. **Label Implication**: The label ""normal"" suggests the text is neutral and devoid of controversial or offending content. However, given the context, a more nuanced approach might be necessary.
   
2. **Key Features Analysis**: Though no specific keywords were identified, terms like ""non lesbians"" and ""dyke"" are noteworthy. The term ""dyke"" can be a slur when used in certain contexts, which may lead to it being perceived as pejorative. However, the context here seems more about expressing frustration over the misuse or appropriation of the term by non-lesbians rather than an outright attack.

3. **Target Group Impact**: The target group here appears to be ""non lesbians"" who use the word ""dyke."" This could potentially be seen as critiquing a behavior rather than targeting a specific group negatively.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**: The tweet's tone expresses annoyance or frustration, not aggression or malice typically associated with hate speech. It seems aimed at discussing cultural appropriation or misuse of identity terms rather than attacking a group based on their sexual orientation.

5. **Conclusion Justification**: Although the tweet uses a term that can be considered a slur in some contexts, its usage here appears to be more complex and nuanced. The text does not promote hatred or violence towards any group but expresses frustration about the appropriation of identity terms. Therefore, while acknowledging the potentially sensitive nature of the language used, it's classified as ""normal"" based on the intent to critique behavior rather than to offend or harm a specific group.

This tweet could be seen as promoting violence or hatred against a specific demographic group. Despite the misspelling, the overall sentiment appears hostile and aggressive.

This creates a hostile environment and promotes prejudice against the targeted group. The context suggests a deliberate withholding of the slur, but its mention still perpetuates hate speech's impact.

The phrase ""hurty words"" suggests a reference to language causing harm or offense, and accusing others of ""inciting violence"" is a serious allegation.

However, without clear context about who is being referred to or what specific actions are deemed as inciting violence, the intent behind these statements remains ambiguous. Additionally, no particular group or individual seems to be directly targeted by this tweet.

The classification of ""normal"" might stem from the lack of overtly aggressive language or direct attacks on identifiable persons or groups. While expressing criticism and making accusations, the text stops short of using explicit hate speech or slurs that would categorize it as ""hate speech"" or even ""offensive"".

In conclusion, this tweet raises concerns about alleged harm caused by others' words and actions, but due to its vague nature and lack of clear targets or inflammatory language, it leans towards a normal classification.

1. The label 'normal' suggests that the content does not contain hate speech or overtly offensive language.
2. Key features are missing, indicating a lack of significant terms or phrases that would suggest otherwise.
3. Although there is mention of a serious topic (rape), it's discussed in the context of prevention and justice rather than used to target or demean any group. 
4. The user seems to be expressing frustration about ineffective measures rather than promoting harm or prejudice.

Explanation: The user's statement implies a lack of concern or action towards addressing instances of rape, which can be perceived as offensive and insensitive towards victims.

1. It employs non-standard pronouns (""he she it"") which can be seen as mocking or diminishing the individual's gender identity.
2. The terms ""feminine"", ""butch"", and ""dyke"" are used in a context that suggests stereotyping and potentially belittling a person based on their perceived sexual orientation and gender expression.

The target of this tweet appears to be individuals who identify as homosexual, specifically those who may present or express themselves in ways that do not conform to traditional gender norms. The tone of the text comes across as derisive and judgmental, indicating an intent to demean or insult based on personal characteristics.

In conclusion, the classification of this text as **Offensive** is justified by its use of pronouns and labels in a way that marginalizes and demeans an individual due to their gender identity and sexual orientation.

1. The label's implication: The tweet employs aggressive and insulting language, targeting specific religious, political, and national groups, which characterizes it as highly provocative and inflammatory.

2. Key features supporting this classification:
   - Usage of terms like ""uneducated"", ""brainwashed"", ""jihadi"", and ""coolie"" reveals a strong intent to demean and insult.
   - The phrase ""narrow-minded extremist"" contributes further to the negative sentiment, labeling the targeted group as rigid and dogmatic.

3. Impact on or reference to target groups:
   - Hindus and BJP (a political party in India) are directly labeled as ""jihadi"", a term commonly associated with terrorism, which is highly inflammatory.
   - Indians are denigrated as ""ungrateful chaddijihadis,"" further intensifying the offense.

4. Context and tone assessment:
   - The tweet appears to be a response to an ongoing debate or discussion, evident from the opening sequence of ""@user"" mentions.
   - The aggressive tone and accusatory language suggest a heated argument rather than a constructive dialogue.

5. Conclusion:
Based on the analysis above, this tweet is classified as offensive due to its use of explicitly insulting terms and generalizations targeting specific religious and political groups. It employs inflammatory rhetoric that contributes significantly to inter-group tensions and conflicts, making it a clear example of an online offense.",32.61,[ 1.0090363 -2.549114   3.7801843 ...  8.100091   3.142838   1.3827765],2, offensive

Here's the analysis:

1. **Label Implication**: The classification 'normal' suggests that while the language used may be strong or controversial, it does not rise to the level of hate speech or deliberately crafted offensiveness.

2. **Key Features Analysis**: The tweet contains the term ""nigga"" which is a colloquial variant of a highly controversial and historically oppressive slur. However, in this context, it appears to critique the hypocritical use of such language by those who are not part of the targeted community and do not actively engage with or respect that community.

3. **Target Group Analysis**: The text refers to both African Americans (as ""black ppl"") and people who use the term without understanding its impact. It highlights a distinction between using a word casually and being confronted with its full, negative connotation by those it harms.

4. **Context and Tone Evaluation**: The tweet seems to educate or make aware rather than to insult or belittle any particular group. Its tone is serious and corrective, intending to highlight the consequences of using sensitive language without understanding its implications.

5. **Conclusion Justifying Classification**: This classification is justified as the text does not promote hate nor direct offense towards a specific group. Instead, it educates about the harm caused by misuse of potent slurs.

Despite containing mild profanity (""ghetto ass""), this expression is commonly used colloquially and does not directly target any group or individual in a malicious manner. The tweet expresses frustration towards bills, which is a mundane and relatable sentiment.

Key Features:
- The usage of ""ghetto ass"" adds emphasis but lacks direct malice.
- Frustration with bills is a common experience that many people share.

Target Group:
- There's no specific target beyond the abstract concept of bills, hence it doesn't directly offend or attack any demographic.

Context and Tone:
- The context appears to be everyday annoyance rather than deep-seated contempt.
- The tone conveys informal venting without apparent intent to harm or degrade.

Conclusion:
This tweet is classified as normal because, despite the colorful language used, it lacks the intent or content characteristic of hate speech or significantly offensive material.

Key features:
- Repeated usage of ""niggas"", an extremely pejorative term for black people. This choice of language is highly inflammatory and contributes significantly to categorizing this text as hate speech.

The intent appears to be creating an in-group versus out-group dynamic by comparing individuals from Pennsylvania and New Jersey in a clearly prejudiced manner. The tone is casual yet deeply problematic given the historical weight and ongoing harm of the slur employed.

In conclusion, the text is classified as hate speech due primarily to its repeated use of a severe racial epithet, which degrades and attacks based solely on race.

- The tweet's language is intended to demean and insult, demonstrating a clear intent to offend. 
- By employing such slurs, the user perpetuates negative stereotypes and contributes to a hostile online atmosphere for the targeted groups.

In conclusion, the use of explicit, degrading language towards specific ethnic and sexual orientation groups justifies classifying this tweet as highly offensive.

Key features supporting this classification include:
1. Criticism of authority: The tweet criticizes those in power (police officials), which is generally considered a part of free speech and not inherently hate speech.
2. Lack of targeted slurs: There are no obvious words or phrases that directly target specific individuals or groups based on protected characteristics.

The tweet's impact largely depends on the ongoing context involving police actions, but it does not appear to promote violence or direct hatred against any particular group.

1. **Label Implication**: The label ""normal"" suggests that while the tweet uses strong language, it does not rise to the level of hate speech or targeted offensiveness.

2. **Key Features Analysis**: Although the tweet includes profanity and frustration directed at ""white bitches"", these terms are used colloquially without clear malicious intent toward an ethnic group. The reference to driving suggests a specific behavior or incident rather than generalized bigotry.

3. **Target Group Impact**: The tweet could be seen as targeting women drivers, but it lacks overt misogyny or gender-based hate. The phrase ""white bitches"" is crude slang rather than a targeted slur against white people.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**: Reading the tweet in context suggests exasperation over perceived bad driving rather than expressing systemic prejudice. The casual tone and emoji undercut any severe animosity.

5. **Conclusion Justifying Classification**: While the language used is certainly vulgar and could be seen as offensive, it appears more a colorful rant about a frustrating encounter than bona fide hate speech or an attack on white women as a group.

The term ""white bitch"" specifically targets women of Caucasian descent in an overtly hostile manner, perpetuating negative stereotypes and creating a demeaning portrayal based on race and gender. 

This tweet's context, discussing someone's business success despite their criminal past, exacerbates the offense by implying that this individual's race and gender have unfairly contributed to her success.

In conclusion, the tweet is classified as ""offensive"" due to its aggressive tone, targeted language, and promotion of negative stereotypes against women and Caucasians.",17.68,[ 4.6876616  4.812334  -1.9223218 ...  6.2215075 -0.5237123  0.7583882],2," offensive.

It provides geographical information about the distribution of a religious group in Serbia without employing pejorative terms or expressing bigotry.

Key features that support this classification include:

1. Descriptive language: The post uses neutral descriptors such as ""local moslimes"", ""south and south west"", and ""special facilities"" to convey information rather than incite hate.
2. Absence of slurs or demeaning terminology: There are no words that could be deemed inherently offensive towards the target group.
3. Contextual background: The text seems to offer a demographic overview without passing judgement, indicating a potentially informative intent.

However, it's essential to recognize that the term ""colored immigrants"" might be perceived as outdated and insensitive. Moreover, mentioning refugees in ""special facilities"" could hint at detention centers or restricted living conditions which may raise humanitarian concerns.

The usage of such derogatory terms categorizes this as hate speech.

Key features like 'nigger' and 'faggot' directly target African and homosexual communities with extreme prejudice. Referring to these groups as ""subhuman"" degrades their very humanity, further intensifying the hatred conveyed. 

The statement ""a war is coming you and your subhuman brethren will not survive it"" openly threatens violence against the targeted groups. This incitement to potential physical harm solidifies its classification under hate speech.

1. **Derogatory terms**: The words ""niggas"" and ""faggots"" are severe slurs targeting African and homosexual individuals respectively, indicating clear prejudice.
2. **Negative connotation**: Coupling these terms with the word ""slime"" intensifies the offensiveness by equating targeted groups to something repulsive.

This classification is justified as the text deliberately employs language intended to demean and offend specific groups based on race and sexual orientation. The emojis (\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude2d) do not mitigate the offense but instead underscore the dismissive tone.

1. The label's implication: The usage of explicit and abusive language towards an individual or group is considered as offensive. In this case, the term ""dry ass white bitch"" directly targets a specific ethnicity and gender.

2. Key features supporting classification: The phrase ""dry ass white bitch"" contains profanity and ethnic slur, making it inflammatory and hostile. This choice of words is both derogatory towards women (bitch) and caucasians (white).

3. Impact on the target group: The language used in the text could deeply offend the targeted individuals - Caucasian women. It promotes prejudice and bigotry against this demographic.

4. Context and tone: The context seems to be a response or comment about someone, indicating a personal attack rather than a general statement. The tone is aggressive and mocking, implying an intent to harm or insult.

5. Conclusion: Given the direct usage of a demeaning ethnic slur combined with abusive language towards women, this text is classified as 'offensive'.

The user is expressing their opinion on two topics: the potential dangers of capitalism and the idea of 'canceling' men and capitalism.

The reference to ""capitalism"" and the humorous tone in phrases like ""lmao"", ""newsies soundtrack"", and ""gotta find a new major now"" suggests more of an informal discussion rather than a targeted attack. The tweet seems to be satirical or ironic in nature, which is further supported by the lack of specific targets.

However, it's essential to consider the context - if this user frequently promotes anti-capitalist views or has a history of attacking specific groups related to these topics, the text could potentially be seen as part of a larger pattern. 

In conclusion, based on the presented text alone and without additional context, this tweet is classified as ""normal"" due to its lack of direct offense, targeted hate, or inflammatory language.

However, it's essential to note that the word ""retarded"" is often considered a slur against those with intellectual disabilities, which could be seen as problematic.

Key Features:
- The term ""retarded"" stands out due to its pejorative connotation and historical use as ableist language.
  
Impact on Target Group:
- While not directly targeting any group, the casual use of ""retarded"" trivializes the challenges faced by those with intellectual disabilities. 

Context and Tone:
- The user seems frustrated but directs their annoyance at a topic's lack of obscurity rather than attacking a specific group or individual.

Conclusion:
Despite containing an ableist term, the text lacks clear intent to harm or demean based on disability status alone, which prevents it from being classified as hate speech. However, its reliance on ableist language warrants consideration and highlights societal issues regarding casual use of slurs.",20.23,[ 5.8117447 -0.8128121  0.6509638 ... 10.252099  -2.4348795  5.363227 ],1," offensive

Explanation: The user's comment, ""this is retarded I kinda expected a more obscene topic not that fucking garlic ain't onions,"" can be considered offensive due to the use of the expletive ""fucking"" multiple times in a derogatory manner towards the topic of garlic not being classified as an onion. This language is uncalled for and unnecessary, adding an aggressive and hostile tone to the conversation. While the comment does not contain any direct hate speech or target any particular group, it is still offensive in its use of strong language."

Key points include the use of ""nigga"" which is a colloquial variant of a highly charged racial slur, and the metaphorical reference to having ""<number> lions with me"" versus the opponent's ""<number> sheep"". 

Despite the potentially controversial language, without clear context it doesn't cross the line into hate speech or direct offensiveness. The slang feels more akin to posturing in an insult battle or rap lyric rather than a targeted attack on any group.

The tone seems to be aggressive machismo rather than genuine hatred or aggression toward a protected class. So while edgy, the intent appears to be more performative than maliciously bigoted speech.

In summary, this falls into a grey area but is categorized as normal due to the lack of directly abusive language or clear intent to promote animus against any group. However, the slang terms and macho posturing walk close to the line of being classified as hate speech or offensiveness in other contexts.",20.99,[ 1.1511163  1.517573  -4.158579  ...  3.8159297 -3.110516  -3.808792 ],1," offensive. The use of the racial slur and derogatory language towards others is not appropriate or respectful. However, it does not meet the threshold for hate speech as it does not directly advocate for harm or violence against a specific group based on their race. Instead, it appears to be a form of disrespectful or threatening language used in a personal conflict."

Key points supporting this classification:
- The user is questioning another user's motives for creating a ""rape report thread"" about Tucker Carlson, a conservative political commentator often criticized for promoting white nationalist ideas.
- The text compares the other user's insinuation that Jesus Christ would be a rapist to calling Carlson a metaphorical representation of a white nationalist news source. This draws a parallel between the two as unfair slanders.
- While mentioning sensitive topics and controversial figures, it does not contain clear deragatory language or direct calls to violence/hatred that would classify it as hate speech or even offensive. 

The text's intent seems to be criticizing what the user perceives as baseless, inflammatory accusations by drawing a parallel to an extreme example in Jesus Christ. The comparison aims to highlight the absurdity and offensiveness of such a claim.

In summary, while touching on charged political topics and figures, the post lacks overtly bigoted language or incitement that would qualify it as hate speech or even just offensive.

The key features such as ""butt fucker"" and ""moslem overlords"" are crucial to this classification. 

- ""Butt fucker"" is a crude homosexual slur that demeans individuals based on their sexual orientation.
- ""Moslem overlords"" carries a derogatory implication towards Islam, suggesting a conspiracy theory where Muslims supposedly control or seek to dominate others.

The text's impact on the targeted groups is significant:

1. **Homosexuals**: The term ""butt fucker"" is used in a demeaning manner, targeting individuals based on their sexual orientation.
2. **Islam**: By using the term ""moslem overlords"", the tweet perpetuates negative stereotypes and conspiracy theories about Islamic control or domination.

The tone of the text is hostile and inflammatory, which indicates an intent to offend rather than engage in meaningful dialogue.

2. **Key Features Analysis**: There are no key features identified in the provided data that would hint at a negative connotation or targeting of any group.

3. **Target Group Impact**: With no specific target mentioned, it's assumed that the text doesn't intend to harm or offend any particular audience.

Although there might be a typo ('moslem' should likely be 'Muslim'), it does not alter the neutral tone of the sentence.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that no derogatory language, targeting, or negative context is present in the text, and considering the factual description of an event without implied negativity, this classification as 'normal' is justified.

These terms collectively serve to degrade and dehumanize the targeted groups.

The text's reference to British elections and the assertion that individuals of African descent should not have voting rights while self-proclaimed ""british [sic] american[s]"" with alleged British ancestry should, reveals a deep-seated belief in white supremacy and ethnic nationalism. The intent appears to incite division and hostility by advocating for exclusionary and prejudiced voting rights based on race and ethnicity.

In conclusion, the classification of this text as hate speech is justified by its use of extreme derogatory language, its targeting of specific groups based on their race and gender, and its promotion of white supremacist ideologies.

1. The use of overtly racist and inflammatory language such as ""dusty niggers"" is a clear indication of hate speech. This terminology targets African Americans in a derisive and denigrating manner.

3. The message appears to be threatening in nature, indicating the speaker is about to 'start following' the opposing group. This implies potential violence or harm, a common element of hate speech.

The term 'nigga' is a highly controversial and inflammatory word that has historically been used to denigrate African Americans. The use of this term in conjunction with other insults like 'dumbass' and the overall aggressive nature of the message creates an environment of hostility and prejudice.

Key Features:
- The term ""dyke"" is a central feature in this classification, as it's an openly hostile and demeaning slur directed at lesbians.
- The action suggested by ""plug the dyke"" implies aggression or hostility towards the targeted group. 

Context & Tone: 
- The tweet uses informal language with a clear intent to mock or deride. This informality doesn't lessen the impact of the slur but rather normalizes it in casual conversation.

Impact on Target:
- The term used is intentionally hurtful and aimed at undermining the dignity and respect of homosexual individuals, particularly lesbians.
- Women are also indirectly targeted through the use of a gender-specific slur which can contribute to a broader culture of misogyny.

- The usage of specific numbers and percentages, indicating a presentation of statistical information rather than opinionated commentary.
- There is no evident intent to provoke or demean based on the phrasing used.

The tweet's reference to another person at work suggests a real-life interaction rather than an abstract discussion, further emphasizing the personal impact of such language. By using this term in describing someone’s appearance or mannerisms (as ""a subway surfer""), the speaker is perpetuating negative stereotypes and undermining the target individual's dignity.

The tweet employs the term ""kike,"" an ethnic slur used to target Jewish individuals. This pejorative language is central in classifying this text as hate speech, with the key features supporting a context that vilifies the targeted group.

The reference to Superman being written by a ""kike"" about his fantasy of defeating fascists injects a tone of mockery and disdain towards both the creator's ethnicity and their purported ideological stance. The usage of ""kek,"" an online slang term for laughter, further trivializes the sentiment behind this hate speech.

This text specifically targets the Jewish community through language that perpetuates historical prejudices and stereotypes. Its classification as hate speech is justified by its explicit use of ethnic slurs and the derisory tone directed at a protected group's cultural contributions and political beliefs.

The target groups mentioned are homosexual individuals, particularly lesbian women, as well as women in general. 

The tone is aggressive and demeaning, displaying clear intent to offend and belittle the subjects based on their sexual orientation and gender.

1. The label 'normal' suggests that while the text includes potentially sensitive language, it does not rise to the level of hate speech or direct offensiveness.
2. Key features are missing, indicating a lack of clear indicators typically associated with hate speech or overtly offensive content.
3. The targets mentioned (Arab, Caucasian, None) suggest that no specific group is being attacked or demeaned. The text seems to be recounting an experience rather than promoting bigotry.
4. Despite the presence of a slur (""sand nigger""), the tone appears more bemused than aggressive or malicious. This suggests the user may be relating an anecdote rather than endorsing the language used.

In conclusion, while the language is certainly distasteful and could be seen as problematic, without additional context to suggest the user is promoting or condoning this slur, it falls short of being labeled as hate speech or overtly offensive content.

- Encouraging forsaking Jesus, further highlighting religious animosity. 
- Advocating a return to ancestral gods, suggesting an attempt to otherize and reject the target's current religious practices.

3. The tweet is directed at Christian individuals or organizations, suggesting that they need to address issues within their own community before commenting on others' lives.

These phrases are not only derogatory but also imply aggressive sexual intent, further escalating their offensiveness.

3. **Impact on Target Groups**: The language used explicitly demeans and objectifies the targeted groups. Referring to a black individual as 'gorilla' evokes historical racist tropes of animalistic dehumanization. Similarly, the term 'nigga' carries a deep legacy of racial hate. Using 'dyke' in the context of forced sexual submission further entrenches homophobic and misogynistic attitudes.

4. **Context and Tone Assessment**: The scenario described involves an alleged physical assault coupled with extremely vulgar language. This not only portrays a violent act but also suggests that such behavior is acceptable, reinforcing dangerous social norms about power dynamics and consent.

Summary:
The tweet's content involves the speaker claiming to tell their girlfriend they will rape her as a joke. This text is classified as offensive due to its disturbing and insensitive nature regarding sexual assault.

Key Features Analysis:
- Mention of telling girlfriend he will 'rape' her.
- Intent to make this statement sound humorous.

Target Group Impact:
The target group here appears to be the speaker's girlfriend, but the broader impact involves trivializing and making light of sexual violence against women. 

Context and Tone Assessment:
The context suggests an attempt at humor which further exacerbates the offensiveness. The casual tone also demonstrates a lack of understanding or empathy regarding the severity of sexual assault.

Conclusion:
This tweet is classified as offensive because it makes light of a serious crime in a flippant manner, disregarding the trauma associated with such acts and promoting a culture that trivializes violence against women.",21.4,[ 5.9680176 -1.7990526  1.0075045 ...  8.921731  -3.5429578  4.2666054],1," offensive.

The tweet's content advocates violence towards an imagined concept of ""gay whales"" and uses religious justification by invoking Jesus' name. This promotes bigotry and incites harm against homosexual groups by equating their existence to something deserving eradication. 

Though whales and the unborn are not direct targets, the language is emblematic of a broader pattern of dehumanization and hostility towards the gay community. The phrase ""for jesus"" attempts to sanctify this violence under the guise of religious conviction.

Despite no specific key features being identified, the combination of aggressive action (""nuke""), vulnerable entities (""unborn whales""), minority group reference (""gay""), and religious invocation creates a clear context of hate speech that demonizes homosexuality through extreme measures and misuses religious sentiment for malicious ends. 

The tweet's tone is vehemently hostile and intolerant, seeking to normalize violent extremism against homosexuals under the pretense of moral righteousness. This intent to incite animosity and promote harm categorically distinguishes it as hate speech with no room for reinterpretation or ambiguity.

In conclusion, the text ""nuke the unborn gay whales for jesus"" is classified as hate speech due to its blatant promotion of violence against an implied homosexual group, misuse of religious dogma to justify bigotry, and dehumanizing language that reduces an already marginalized community to something deserving of eradication.

- The tweet text: ""will this stop uk moslem overbreeding perhaps from <date> child tax credit worth up to <money> per child per year will now only be paid for the first two children in any family""
  
The classification of 'hatespeech' is justified by the presence of pejorative language and the targeting of a specific religious group. Key features such as 'moslem', which is a misspelling intended to mock, and 'overbreeding', contribute to the hate speech label.

These terms are used in a context that suggests negative stereotypes about the Muslim community's reproductive practices, implying an undesired increase in their population due to purported excessive breeding. This reinforces xenophobic sentiments and promotes bigotry towards Arab and Islamic minorities.

The tweet's tone is derisive and judgmental, intending to stir animosity towards these groups by portraying them as burdens on society because of perceived overpopulation. Such language has the potential to incite violence or prejudicial actions against targeted communities.

In conclusion, the classification of 'hatespeech' is validated by the inflammatory language, the direct targeting of religious and ethnic minorities, and the propagation of hate-filled stereotypes.

The term ""nigglet"" is an intensely derogatory alteration of an already offensive word, used here to demean and degrade individuals based on their race. By proposing that the father will steal the bag with the child inside, it perpetuates negative stereotypes about African fathers being thieves.

The tweet's key features include the use of ""nigglet,"" which is a blatant slur against people of African descent, and the suggestion of criminal behavior by the father figure, reinforcing a stereotype. The target group is clearly identified as African due to the specific language used.

The context and tone are crucial in determining intent; here, the tweet employs dehumanizing language and promotes a scenario that suggests criminality based on race. This contributes to an atmosphere of hostility and animosity against the targeted community.

The tweet text contains the highly offensive and derogatory term ""niggas"". This racial slur is used to target African-Americans in a negative context, associating them with something being ""a fluke"" or insignificant. The reference to ""yellow album"" could be interpreted as furthering this negative stereotype.

Key features:
- Use of the n-word: One of the most inflammatory and hate-filled slurs targeting black individuals.
- Negative connotation: Suggests that African-Americans perceived the referenced album as less significant, reinforcing an unfavorable bias.

The tweet's tone is derisive and demeaning towards African-Americans, using a term with deep historical roots in oppression and bigotry. By categorizing this text as hate speech, it acknowledges the severity of such language and its impact on targeted communities.

Conclusion:
Given the presence of highly inflammatory racial slurs directed at African-Americans in a negative context, the tweet is appropriately classified as hate speech. Such terminology has no place in civil discourse and only serves to perpetuate divisions and hatred based on ethnicity.",21.27,[ 1.4355325  1.4544165  2.0298731 ...  8.408996  -6.40487    0.9046759],1, hate speech

The key features supporting this classification are the explicit language and the implied comparison of the targeted group (men) to an oppressed group (women). 

The tweet's target appears to be men, specifically those exhibiting behavior that the author perceives as feminine or stereotypically associated with women. By using a term like ""bitches,"" the author is not only insulting these men but also perpetuating negative stereotypes about women.

Furthermore, the inclusion of the emoji (👀) adds an element of shock or disapproval to the message, suggesting that this behavior from men is viewed as particularly egregious by the author. 

In conclusion, the tweet's use of a gendered slur and its implication that acting like a ""bitch"" is undesirable contribute to its classification as offensive.

The context, involving an anecdote from a Motley Crew show, suggests a violent incident that is casually recounted, reinforcing the offensiveness. The user's choice of words demonstrates a lack of empathy and perpetuates negative stereotypes about both women of the speaker's grandmother's generation and individuals of Hispanic origin.

3. Generalization: Asserting that ""muslims lie and deceive <percent> of the time"" makes a broad, negative claim about an entire religious community without substantiation.

4. The tone is dismissive and mocking, showing clear intent to belittle and insult the individuals based on their sexual orientation.

1. **Label Implication**: The use of ""hoes"" objectifies and degrades women, making the tweet inherently misogynistic.
2. **Key Features**: The slang term trivializes and perpetuates negative stereotypes about women, especially in the context of sharing, which implies a transactional view of relationships.
3. **Impact on Target Group**: The target group, women, are demeaned by this language, reducing them to objects for distribution or consumption.

The target group is clearly identified as Jewish people, with the term ""kike"" being a slur used against them. The language is meant to incite hate and anger towards both Trump and the broader Jewish community by implying deceitfulness based solely on ethnicity.

The tone of the text is aggressive and hostile, leaving no doubt about the user's negative intent. The direct insult and use of profanity highlight their disdain in a very provocative manner.

The text suggests that ""blacks"" protect ""whites"" despite alleged historical injustices which include claims of spreading HIV/AIDS and rape. The reference to these acts is used to inflame sentiments against both races, indicating an intent to foster division and hatred.

This text is classified as 'normal'. Here's why:

1. The label 'normal' implies that the text does not contain overtly hateful or aggressive content targeting any group or individual.

2. While it mentions a Syrian refugee, there are no key features or slurs used that would qualify this as hate speech or even offensive. It simply states a fact and expresses an opinion on how elders should be treated, which is a common societal norm.

3. The target seems to be the person referred to as ""<user>"". However, the tweet doesn't appear to directly insult or attack them but rather criticizes their behavior towards the elders of the country that granted them asylum.

4. Despite carrying a tone of disappointment or disapproval, it lacks the intense negativity or aggression that would categorize this under hate speech or even offensive.

5. In conclusion, while the tweet discusses sensitive topics such as refugees and protests, it does not cross into hate speech or overtly aggressive territory. The user is expressing an opinion in a direct manner without using abusive language or promoting harm or hatred towards any group, which justifies its classification as 'normal'.",30.21,[ 5.6868386  1.88158   -2.1550932 ... -3.120885   1.4780588 -2.1343765],1, normal

1. The term 'white trash' is a key feature of this classification. It's a pejorative slur used to describe people of Caucasian descent who are perceived as lower class or displaying unsavory behavior.

2. The text targets a specific group (people of Caucasian descent), employing language that perpetuates stereotypes and social prejudices associated with socioeconomic status and race. 

3. While the user expresses affection for this term, the tweet's impact is still denigrating due to its intrinsic negative connotations towards the target group.

4. Analyzing the context and tone suggests an intent to provoke or stir controversy by openly endorsing a loaded phrase in public discourse.

In conclusion, despite the user's claim of 'love' for the term, usage of 'white trash' in this context is inherently demeaning and propagates negative stereotypes. This justifies its classification as 'Offensive', with the key feature being the deployment of a recognized ethnic and classist slur.",24.05,[ 2.2478294  1.3545082 -1.5077133 ... 10.699807   1.8914126  2.0918565],1," Offensive.

Here's a concise explanation:

1. The text contains strongly derogatory and threatening language directed at an individual of Muslim faith (referred to as ""muzzie""), which is a clear indicator of hate speech.

2. Key features supporting this classification include:
   - Use of the term ""koran"" in a mocking manner, which demeans the Quran and the user's religious beliefs.
   - The phrase ""rub it in pig shit and suck my dick"", an extremely vulgar and aggressive statement meant to debase and threaten.

3. The text targets a Muslim individual by repeatedly attacking their faith with profanity and suggesting they are inferior and unwelcome in America (""muzzie free america"").

4. The overall tone is hostile, aggressive, and threatening, with no room for interpretation as anything but hate-filled invective.

A more fitting label would be ""hate speech"" or at least ""offensive"".

While the tweet doesn't use direct slurs, it employs provocative language and violent imagery. The phrase ""they throw faggots off of rooftops"" is particularly aggressive, promoting violence against homosexuals. This creates a hostile environment.

The reference to ""a witch hunt"" and ""lynch mob"" insinuates that Caucasian individuals are unjustly targeted or persecuted, which could promote animosity towards other groups perceived as responsible for this supposed persecution.

The tweet's intent seems to provoke fear or anger in its target audience by likening a situation to extreme acts of violence. This inflammatory tone supports the classification of hate speech.

In conclusion, despite lacking overt slurs, the text employs threatening language and violent imagery targeting specific demographics (Caucasians and homosexuals), which qualifies it as hate speech rather than normal discourse.",21.37,[ 1.618776   5.216036  -3.825178  ...  6.878415  -3.5639236  2.3918135],1, hate speech

The word ""nigger"" is a notorious slur that has been historically used to oppress and belittle black people.
